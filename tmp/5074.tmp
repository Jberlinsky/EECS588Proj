<p>NEW YORK, NY &#x2013; One fast-food chain is trying to revive its founder&#x2019;s legacy and reputation!</p>
<p>Over the past decade or two, KFC has gone through a revolution. A revolution that seems to have only featured a couple of cameos by its founder, Colonel Sanders. In the midst of new items such as the double down and a move to include grilled chicken on the menu, the white suited figure has become a distant memory. Today marks not only what would have been the founders 120th birthday, but the push to revive his prestige.</p>
<p>Colonel Harland Sanders&#x2019; punch line back in the day, &#x201C;finger-lickin&#x2019; good&#x201D; was a staple when one thought of KFC. That isn&#x2019;t so much the case today. Young adults, growing up in an age of tech gadgets and &#x201C;faster-food,&#x201D; couldn&#x2019;t tell you who Colonel Sanders was even if he had a name tag. More than six in 10 Americans ages 18 to 25 &#x2013; the chain&#x2019;s key demographic &#x2013; couldn&#x2019;t identify him in the KFC logo, according to a survey last week by the chain.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, five in 10 believe he&#x2019;s a made-up icon and three in 10 haven&#x2019;t a clue who he was. Poor Colonel Sanders, the man who made fried chicken what it is, couldn&#x2019;t win a popularity contest if his life depended on it.</p>
<p>Well KFC has had about all that it can handle and it&#x2019;s going to make sure its founder&#x2019;s name and image is remembered. Today, the world&#x2019;s largest chicken chain, with 15,000 outlets in 109 countries, unleashed an online PR blitz aimed at bringing the Facebook generation eye-to-eye with the venerable colonel.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As time has gone by, the younger generation didn&#x2019;t get to see and experience him like other generations did,&#x201D; says spokeswoman Laurie Schalow. &#x201C;We plan to celebrate the fact that our founder was a real person.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Give me liberty or give me death! &#x2026; oops sorry, got carried away.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is KFC&#x2019;s own doing. Over the years, they have put Colonel Sanders in a red apron as apposed to his iconic white suits. And it has turned its Kentucky Fried Chicken name into KFC.</p>
<p>KFC is taking the route the Domino&#x2019;s Pizza took last year. The pizza chain launched a new campaign last year in which they mocked themselves and blatantly admitted that their pizza tasted like cardboard. They threw out the old recipe, came up with a new one, and threw out incentives so that their fan base would taste the new product. The end result &#x2026; sales skyrocketed.</p>
<p>A great move by KFC to get back in touch with its roots and make it&#x2019;s name &#x2013; Kentucky Fried Chicken &#x2013; mean something again.</p>
