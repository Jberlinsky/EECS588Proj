The company said Thursday that it withdrew all products from the supplier, Dezhou Fujude Food Company, and that affected customers were offered compensation.     </p><p>It also says it plans to add DNA testing to its meat products in China.     </p><p>Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., has 404 stores in China. A spokesman for the company, Kevin Gardner, says only a select number of stores were affected, but didn't give a specific number.     </p><p>It's not the first time a U.S. company has encountered supply issues in China, where food safety is a significant concern among consumers. Yum Brands Inc., which owns KFC, is still working to repair its reputation after a Chinese TV report in 2012 that showed some of its suppliers were giving chickens unapproved levels of antibiotics.</p></div></div>
