				<p><strong><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/mcdonalds-expands-test-flight-chicken-wings-172704936--finance.html">From the Associated Press:</a></strong></p>		
		
<blockquote>
<p>(McDonald&#x2019;s) is set to expand its test of chicken wings to Chicago  this week, after a successful run in Atlanta last year. The wings are  being sold in servings of three, five or 10 pieces with prices starting  at $3, according to Lynne Collier, an analyst with Sterne Agee.</p>
<p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1357654868409_229">A spokeswoman for McDonald&#x2019;s confirmed the test in Chicago  would start this week at about 500 restaurants but said there weren&#x2019;t  any plans yet to bring the wings to other cities. She noted that no new  sauces were being offered with the wings and that the creamy ranch sauce  would be the default dipping sauce.</p>
