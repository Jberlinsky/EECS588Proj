A student has found a chicken kidney in his KFC order.<p>Ibrahim Langoo discovered the organ when he visited the fast-food restaurant in Colchester, Essex with his friend Laura Canning.</p><p>The 19-year-olds bought a Gladiator box meal, which Canning began with the fillet burger. Langoo chose to eat the chicken pieces, according to <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4729393/Finger-Lickin-Bad.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sun</em></a>.</p><p>"The first piece was absolutely fine," recalled Langoo. "I was hungry and polished it off.</p><p>"I have a habit of picking the chicken off the bone with my fingers, and as I pulled the second piece apart, I saw this horrible wrinkled foreign body."</p><p>Langoo continued: "I threw it down onto my tray immediately. It looked like a brain.</p><p>"I suddenly felt grim and really sick. I couldn't bring myself to pick the lump up so I went to the serving counter to complain."</p><p>KFC apologised to Langoo and offered vouchers. However, Langoo stated that he is unlikely to return to the fast-food restaurant.</p><p>"I never want to eat KFC again - in Colchester or anywhere else," he said. "I'll eat chicken at home, where I can see how it's been prepared."</p><p>A KFC spokesman commented: "We always try to ensure the highest standards in all of our restaurants.</p><p>"We're very sorry about Mr Langoo's experience, and while there was no health risk, we agree it was unsightly.</p><p>"We will be carrying out a full investigation and providing him with a gesture of goodwill."</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/odd/news/a448534/failed-jewellery-robbers-break-into-kfc-by-mistake.html">&gt; Failed jewellery robbers break into KFC by mistake</a></strong><br><strong><a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/odd/news/a394964/kfc-launches-university-degree.html">&gt; KFC launches university degree</a></strong></p></div></div>
