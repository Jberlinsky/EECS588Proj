<p>A rumour that KFC uses mutated chickens with extra limbs is going viral on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://dailybuzzlive.com/archives/3753">story</a> citing a University of New Hampshire study claims that the federal government forced KFC to shorten its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken when it stopped using &#x201C;real chickens&#x201D; and started using these tube-fed &#x201C;genetically modified organisms.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The post, which has now been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, was published on the viral news site Daily Buzz Live, pumping new life into a rumour that has been circulating for more than a decade.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is absolutely no truth to this ridiculous urban legend, which has been debunked many times,&#x201D; KFC spokesman Rick Maynard told Business Insider in an email. &#x201C;KFC uses only top quality poultry from trusted companies like Tyson and Pilgrim&#x2019;s Pride &#x2014; the same brands customers know from their local supermarkets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The rumour has also been thoroughly debunked <a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/kfc.asp">by Snopes.com, which notes</a> that the company&#x2019;s 1991 name change had to do with menu pages and a desire to eliminate the word &#x201C;fried,&#x201D; and nothing to do with governmental regulations.</p>
<p>But apparently, a lot of people find no reason to question the information that&#x2019;s making the rounds on social media:</p>

&#x201C;These so-called &#x2018;chickens&#x2019; are kept alive by tubes inserted into their bodies to pump blood and nutrients throughout their structure,&#x201D; according to the completely false story. &#x201C;They have no beaks, no feathers and no feet. They grow with multiple legs and wings on one &#x2018;chicken.&#x2019; Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them. This is great for KFC because it saves them money for their production costs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The University of New Hampshire has also <a href="http://unhmagazine.unh.edu/sp00/chickensp00.html">repeatedly debunked</a> the claim that they authored a study on KFC&#x2019;s mutant chickens. </p>
<p>&#x201C;An active Internet hoax, of the urban legend type, falsely claims that KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is using genetically engineered organisms instead of chickens,&#x201D; according to a statement posted on the university&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.unh.edu/BoilerPlate/kfc.html">website</a>. &#x201C;The hoax includes reference to an unspecified study of KFC done at the University of New Hampshire and there is no such research or study that was done here.&#x201D;</p>
