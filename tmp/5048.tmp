<p>Samuel L. Jackson was being interview by a Hollywood entertainment reporter on live television when the anchor made a serious mistake: confusing Samuel L. Jackson with Laurence Fishburne.</p>
<p>The anchor asks Jackson about his Super Bowl commercial, which confuses Jackson because he didn&#x2019;t star in any Super Bowl commercials this year. Finally, they both realize what has happened and Jackson goes off:</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re as crazy as the people on Twitter. I&#x2019;m not Laurence Fishburne! We don&#x2019;t all look alike&#x2026;You&#x2019;re the entertainment reporter for this station? And you don&#x2019;t know the difference between me and Laurence Fishburne? That must be a very short line for your job outside there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The reporter tries to move on to discuss Jackson&#x2019;s upcoming film, <i>RoboCop</i>, but Jackson doesn&#x2019;t let him off the hook that easily. He continues to mock the reporter, basically giving him a list of all the black guys on television that Samuel L. Jackson is not.</p>
<p>Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury in <i>Marvel&#x2019;s The Avengers</i>. Laurence Fishburne reprised his role as Morpheus from <i>The Matrix</i> for a <a title="KIA&#x2019;s Super Bowl Commercial: Morpheus From The Matrix Returns" href="http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/01/29/kias-super-bowl-commercial-morpheus-from-the-matrix-returns/">Super Bowl commercial</a>. They are not the same person.</p>
