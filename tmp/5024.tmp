								<p><em>Editor's Note: We're serving up ChickieNobs, beard transplants, a Judy Garland offspring reunion, and Professor William S. Burroughs in today's roundup.</em></p>
<p>There's <a href="http://dailybuzzlive.com/archives/3753" target="_blank">a bizarre "news" story being passed around</a> claiming that Kentucky Fried Chicken changed its name to KFC in order to avoid false advertising charges, because the meat comes from genetically mutated organisms: "They have no beaks, no feathers and no feet. They grow with multiple legs and wings..." In other words, exactly like "ChickieNobs," the fictional fast food enjoyed by characters in Margaret Atwood's <em>Oryx and Crake</em>. But don't believe everything you read -- <a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/kfc.asp">Snopes has debunked the myth</a>, reminding us that the name-change occurred back in 1991, back before we could even properly CG animate a mutant chicken in the movies, let alone serve one up with a biscuit.</p>
<p>Speaking of techno-deception, it appears that stars like Ryan Gosling and George Clooney have inspired a new plastic surgery craze for men: <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/02/beards-facial-hair-transplants-ryan-gosling">facial hair transplants</a>. For a mere $7K, you can have hair from elsewhere on your body relocated to the sparser areas of your face. (You could probably have some of Gosling's actual hair transplanted to your face, but it's gonna cost a lot more.)</p>
<p>The star alignment chart for this Sunday's Oscar broadcast must be particularly fortuitous: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/judy-garland-s-children-will-reunite-for-wizard-of-oz-tribute-20140224">All three of Judy Garland's children will appear together</a> to pay tribute to "The Wizard of Oz," which turns seventy-five this year. Liza Minelli and Lorna Luft have remained in the public eye all along, but appearances by Joe Luft are rare. Looking forward to this memorable triple-sighting!</p>
<p>Want to learn creative writing from one of the most twisted minds of the twentieth century? It turns out that William S. Burroughs recorded <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/take_a_creative_writing_course_with_william_burroughs">a series of lectures for Naropa University in 1979</a> -- that's right about when his long-form fiction was reaching the apex of its hallucinatory weirdness. You may have arrived very late to class, but I doubt Professor Bill withhold a good grade as long as you have a good story to tell.</p>
