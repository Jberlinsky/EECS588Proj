Farley &amp; Sathers Candy Corn  <br>
Candy Corn is gluten free. However, Candy Corn may be packaged on lines with other products containing gluten. While we do wash lines between packaging runs, cross contamination is still <br>
<br>
possible. At this time, Farley's &amp; Sathers Candy Company, Inc. does not offer a list of gluten free items. Production processes change too frequently to allow us to provide an accurate and updated <br>
<br>
list of gluten free items. <br>
Package information is the most current information we can provide our consumers in regards to food allergies and intolerances. Any lists may or may not apply to an item purchased by the <br>
<br>
consumer, without the date of manufacture or the location of manufacture and packaging. <br>
Many of our items are gluten free. Please check our package labels for wheat indications in the allergy statement. If you are concerned about a specific product, please email the name of the <br>
<br>
product, package code, and UPC. I am happy to research any item you might have a question on. Thank you for taking the time to contact us with your questions. <br>

Joseph Schmidt Chocolates  <br>
Yes, some of our products do contain flour (in the biscotti). This is clearly marked on the label of anything containing &#x201C;biscotti&#x201D; (like Biscotti Bars) or &#x201C;biscotti crunch&#x201D; which is in all the Mini <br>
<br>
Mosaics and most of the large Mosaics. The &#x201C;gluten free&#x201D; statement refers to our Truffles, Mini Truffles, bars (except the Biscotti Bars.) We don&#x2019;t use flour in our chocolates or for packaging.  <br>
<br>
While it is true that biscotti is processed (chopped up or ground into &#x201C;crunch&#x201D;) in our factory, we are very diligent about keeping this process separate from the chocolates we make. (We are <br>
<br>
equally diligent about segregating any peanuts from our chocolates which don&#x2019;t contain peanuts or tree-nuts.) Our cookies are baked and packed in a separate facility; each cookie is packed into a <br>
<br>
sealed cello bag.<br>
<br>

Are your products gluten free? Answer: To the best of our knowledge, our products are gluten free, with the exception of our cookie products such as Cookies and Creams, or S'mores. These <br>
<br>
products contain a small amount of gluten. This would be clearly indicated on the ingredient label as containing wheat. However, our wheat-containing products are run on shared equipment with our <br>
<br>
other products, so the possibility of cross-contamination can't be completely ruled out despite our efforts to prevent it.<br>

Valrhona Chocolate  <br>
Dark and Milk Chocolate are gluten-free.  &#x201C;Our chocolates, dark and milk in bars and squares, do not contain any gluten as ingredients.  However, as we are very concerned to protect our consumers from <br>
<br>
this allergy, we cannot guarantee that our &#x2018;&#x2019;ganache&#x2019;&#x2019; chocolates are gluten-free, as we use wheat starch as a moulding agent for some of that products. There is always a possible risk of <br>
<br>
cross-contact from occasional traces in ingredients, equipment or environment.<br>
