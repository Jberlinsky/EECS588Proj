A 21-year-old man from Overland Park, KS is one of the few people that know the feeling.</p><p>Yesterday, this unnamed admirer of deep-fried chicken approached the KFC drive-thru like millions of people do everyday around the world. Except there was a surprise. Where there was supposed to be Colonel Sanders&#x2019; famous chicken, sat the restaurant&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.kmbc.com/r/26981434/detail.html">bank deposit bag</a>. The article doesn&#x2019;t specify how much money was in the bag, but considering how much Midwesterners enjoy their fried food it was probably a fortune to the 21 year old.</p><p>According to the kid&#x2019;s story, he didn&#x2019;t look in his bag of deliciousness until he got home, where he discovered the miraculous bag of cash. He then immediately called the police, explained what happened, and asked to get escorted back to the KFC to return the money.</p><p>If this story is true, it&#x2019;s a tremendous act of honesty. But since I&#x2019;m debilitatingly skeptical there are a few details about the young man&#x2019;s story that simply don&#x2019;t match up. What 21 year old doesn&#x2019;t stick his hand into his bag of fast-food for a taste? I don&#x2019;t care that fried chicken is hard to eat while driving&#x2014;where there is delicious greasy food, college kids find a way. And how on earth did he not notice the absence of his fried chicken&#x2019;s savory smell?</p><p>That&#x2019;s probably because he was too busy counting his Benjamins at the first stoplight, and figuring out how long his new beer budget would last him. Until our anonymous chicken-loving hero&#x2019;s guilt and a grumbling stomach took over.</p><p>According to Overland Park&#x2019;s police chief, John Douglass, the nameless KFC customer was a model citizen and &#x201C;a great example of honesty and doing the right thing.&#x201D; But here at Death and Taxes we ask the tough questions and invent speculation, because lets face it, conspiracy theories are so much more fun.</p><p>The journey to the drive-thru window is a miserable place. It&#x2019;s supposed to be simple, speak into the machine, pay, and eat. But it rarely that simple. Someone inevitably holds up the line, whether it be a guy ordering 50 junior bacon <a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/39372/fast-food-lies-theyre-supersized/">cheeseburgers</a>, or a teenager walking through the drive-through. The food-god taking your order through the speaker sounds like adults in Charlie Brown, and your order almost always gets fucked up.</p><p>Our mystery man was repaid for all the wasted, frustrated minutes, hours and days we&#x2019;ve all spent waiting for our food only to be disappointed when the fries were missed or the burger was cold. He had the opportunity to be the funniest fugitive of 2011, instead he did the right thing.</p><p>Damn the Midwest and their integrity.</p></div></div>
