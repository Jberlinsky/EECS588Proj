<p>"America's Back!" screams the latest cover of Newsweek magazine in red, white and blue. "The remarkable tale of our economic turnaround."</p> 
<p>The magazine lauds many of the same indicators favored by every economic cheerleader: The Dow Jones industrial average at 11,000; a recent spike in auto sales, 162,000 new jobs created in March, banks repaying their bailout funds, growth in the nation's gross domestic product; and some companies' willingness to restructure bad debts.</p> 
<p>"America still leads the world at processing failure," the article argued, not even acknowledging some of the runners up, like maybe nations in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> 
<p>A sidebar quoted four leading economists, three of whom expect a long, slow or muted recovery, which isn't so remarkable after all. But this is how you sell magazines in an economy that remains roughly $1 trillion a year smaller than it used to be.</p> 
<p>In late 2007, as the U.S. economy began to crumble, Cheryl Bachelder became CEO of AFC Enterprises Inc., the Atlanta-based franchisor of about 2,000 Popeyes restaurants around the world.</p> 
<p>Her charge was to take a mature and stagnant chicken chain and make it grow amid the worse downturn since the Great Depression. Today, Popeyes' same-store sales and profits are rising, and AFC's stock has about doubled over last year.</p> 
<p>"Last year, we opened 95 restaurants," she said. "That's about 1,350 jobs."</p> 
<p>But this isn't to be taken as a sign that the recession is over.</p> 
<p>"If you just look at what's being advertised on TV right now, it is wildly competitive," she said. "Everybody's got a dollar menu. Everybody's got a $2.99 special meal every day of the week   Wal-Mart just rolled back prices on 10,000 items, McDonald's just decided to offer $1 drinks all summer long   I think that should be a clue that it's not over yet."</p><div class="articlePosition3"><div class="articleImageBox"><span class="articleImage"><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/portlet/article/html/imageDisplay.jsp?contentItemRelationshipId=2966013" target="_new"><img src="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2010/0417/20100417_122028_Newsweek_cover_200.jpg" width="200" title="" alt="" border="0"></a></span><p class="articleImageCaption">(Newsweek)</p></div></div> 
<p>Bachelder has worked at Gillette Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., RJR Nabisco, Domino's Pizza Inc. and even KFC Corp. She is on the board of the National Restaurant Association and True Value Hardware Corp. She also has three daughters. So she has a pretty good handle on what consumers are really thinking.</p> 
<p>"My favorite line that we hear from our customers is, 'You have to have a job to eat.'"</p> 
<p>So Popeyes polled customers, asking what they could spend eating out when a family leader becomes unemployed. Answer: $2 for breakfast, $3 to $4 for lunch, and $5 for dinner.</p> 
<p>"They said, 'I can buy the chicken and one side, but I can't buy a beverage and desert," Bachelder said.</p> 
<p>It's a sad sight: Whole families flocking to Popeyes, sharing entrees, skimping on sides, forgoing beverages and sometimes even those flaky buttermilk biscuits.</p> 
<p>Popeyes responded by adjusting its menus and prices.</p> 
<p>Bachelder also went full bore on a plan to nationally advertise for the first time, even as many other retailers pulled back on advertising. She also rebranded the chain from Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.</p> 
<p>Not only did her efforts maintain Popeyes' core customer base, but Popeyes also benefited from new customers who can no longer afford the pricier places where they used to eat.</p> 
<p>This in turn helped Popeyes' existing franchisees open more stores. Getting new franchisees, however, remains a challenge.</p> 
<p>"The only people getting any money at all are proven, large retail operators," she said. "So what does that say for new entrepreneurs?"</p> 
<p>Everything that economists point to as a sign of growth usually comes with some kind of qualifier.</p> 
<p>The Dow is at 11,000, but interest rates have been artificially low for years. Many of the big banks have repaid their Troubled Asset Relief Program funds and reported profits, but they have been gorging on nearly free funds from the Federal Reserve Bank. GDP is up, but so is the national debt. Auto sales are up, but it's off a very low base and sparked by 0 percent interest financing. We created jobs in March, but most of them were temporary, or census-taking, or government or health care jobs.</p>&#xA0;
<p>"I've never met an economist that I can believe," Bachelder said.</p> 
<p>And it has been so difficult to sell chicken in an epoch of nearly 10 percent unemployment that KFC recently launched the "Double Down." It's a desperate attempt to reinvent the sandwich with no bread or vegetables. Just two slabs of chicken with bacon and cheese in between, outraging nutritionists nationwide.</p> 
<p>"It's not something we would do," Bachelder said. "But for them, the customer will decide."</p> 
<p>Meantime, a chicken in every pot remains a tall order.</p> 
<p>"I think it's a going to be long, slow recovery, and I'm hoping it's something shorter than Japan's   I'm planning on this year being a year just as tough as last year."</p> 
<p>As for cheerleading economic headlines, let them roll.</p> 
<p>"They make me smile," Bachelder said, "because they point to one of America's greatest strengths   We're eternally optimistic   But you have to marry that with a dose of reality   The numbers aren't there yet."</p>
