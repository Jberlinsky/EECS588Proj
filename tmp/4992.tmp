Troma <i>is</i> a Z-grade film production company that made a few bucks off its Toxic Avenger series and has now released <i>"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead,"</i> said to be its best movie. Here's the scary part: It probably is Troma's best movie.

Uck, it's strictly for fans of this stuff. The movie is a parody in the broadest sense of the word -- as in, "We don't know what 'parody' really means, and we certainly don't have the sophistication to bring it off, but we do know it's doing something sort of like someone else already did, only so stupid some really stupid people will think it's funny." The object of the parody is the George A. Romero "Night of the Living Dead" opus, which was probably already a parody, but the Troma spin is this: Instead of zombies, let's have zombie chickens. Setting: a KFC outlet. Action: Mutant chicken people show up and start treating humans like chickens, as in "make a wish" or "take her to the meat slicer."

Gore: endless. Disgust: endless. Gloppy substances: endless. Best line: "Humans . . . the other white meat." Best performance: Ron Jeremy, porn icon. Worst performance: Ron Jeremy, porn icon. And finally, point: none.
