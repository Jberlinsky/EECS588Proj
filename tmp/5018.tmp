<p>For some folks, gnawing between tiny bones for hard-to-get meat and getting sauce all over your face are a crucial part of the chicken wing experience. If you&#x2019;d like a less messy and more convenient solution, watch this wing disassembly.</p>
<p>Chef John of the Food Wishes blog shows off a method here that leaves the eater with a solid strip of meat you can consume as you wish.  You could probably get away with only removing the tiny bone and using the larger bone as a holding piece, but either way, it&#x2019;s probably a bit more formal and fancy than the normal process of digging in.</p>
<p>In my 10 years of living in Buffalo, NY&#x2014;the formal and rhetorical chicken wing capital of the world&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never seen someone eat a wing like this, or even attempt it. Having said that, I&#x2019;m definitely willing to give it a try. Got a better wing method? We&#x2019;re definitely open to suggestions in the comments.</p>
