<p>Collider reader &#x201C;Vradst&#x201D; sent us a link to an interesting video this morning. &#xA0;Vradst tells us that he/she bought the latest issue of Wired Magazine for the iPad and that in place of the usual digital animation that accompanies the issue, there was a mysterious video shot by <strong><em>District 9</em></strong> director Neill Blomkamp.&#xA0; The video shows a couple of guys with a handheld camera discovering a dead, strange-looking creature on the side of the road.&#xA0; The creature has been marked with a stamp that reads &#x201C;18.12 AGM Heartland Pat Pend USA&#x201D; with the outer-circle reading &#x201C;US Inspected and Approved&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Hit the jump to check out the video and a refresher on Blomkamp&#x2019;s potential follow-up, <strong><em>Elysium</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Vradst for the heads-up.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.collider.com/2010/06/23/hobbit-neill-blomkamp-not-directing-working-elysium/" target="_blank">June</a>, while <strong><em>The Hobbit</em></strong> was still looking for a director to replace Guillermo del Toro, Blomkamp&#x2019;s name came up as a possible replacement.&#xA0; However, Blomkamp&#x2019;s camp said that he was committed to working on a sci-fi script called <em>Elysium</em>.&#xA0; Nothing was known about the film other than it took place on another planet.&#xA0; Of course, it&#x2019;s still possible this video is teasing <em>Elysium</em> since scripts change and stories evolve.&#xA0; This could also be for a completely different movie or something else entirely.&#xA0; And while it would be awesome if he were teasing <strong><em>District 10</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.collider.com/2009/10/22/mrc-will-produce-director-neill-blomkamp-next-movie-and-it-isnt-a-sequel-to-district-9/" target="_self">Blomkamp has said</a> his next movie will be sci-fi but it won&#x2019;t be a sequel to <em>District 9</em>.</p>
