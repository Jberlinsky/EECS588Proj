<div><div>Written by Tom Brown<p>Email: Wondrhampster@Live.com</p><p>Quick little word.&#xA0; I don't mind questions, and if sending me one regarding<br>the witcher, be sure to put "The Witcher" as the subject or I'm liable to<br>delete it thinking its junk mail.&#xA0; Also, I'm not the fastest person when it<br>comes to checking email.&#xA0; I do it maybe three times a week.&#xA0; So if you send<br>me something and I don't get right back to you the very next day, its <br>probably because I haven't gotten around to looking, not because I'm singling<br>you out as the person I want to torture this week.</p><p>This is also the first FAQ I've done, so cut me some slack. Enjoy!</p><p>Last updated on the 6th of May, 2008<br>Version 1.1<br>===============================================================================</p><p>SPOILER ALERT!!!&#xA0; This FAQ does at times give away information that otherwise<br>would not have been known at the current juncture.</p><p>About this FAQ:<br>This guide was written based on Patch 1.3 and a mix of normal and hard<br>difficulty settings.</p><p>About Monster Hunts:<br>During chapters 1 through 5, there are unique monsters that can be hunted for<br>monetary rewards.&#xA0; These monsters have their own name and are generally<br>stronger than their generic counterparts.&#xA0; When killed, a trophy can be taken<br>from these creatures.&#xA0; That trophy has its own space within the inventory and<br>will appear on Geralt's waist in game.&#xA0; There are also item rewards given when<br>a certain number of unique monsters have been killed.&#xA0; These item rewards are<br>given when three trophies, five trophies, and ten trophies have been turned in.<br>The first item reward at three trophies will be a Svarog Rune Stone which<br>temporarily increases a weapon's chance at hitting and damage inflicted by 40%.<br>The second reward at 5 monsters dead is a Perun stone which temporarily<br>increases hit chance and damage by 60% and critical hit by 30%.<br>The reward for all ten trophies turned in is a choice between:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;A silver sword called Moonblade that has +100% damage.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;A steel sword called Mahakaman Rune Sihill that has +100% damage and<br>penetrates opponent armor.</p><p>The prologue and epilogue do not have any unique monsters to hunt.</p><p>All monster hunts will be the first quests listed under the chapter, because<br>these are totally option accept for chapter 2 and can pretty much be done any<br>time during the chapter, with the exception of Chapters 1, 2, and 5. One of the<br>monsters for Chapter 1 is not accessible until after a specific quest.&#xA0; One of<br>the monsters in Chapter 2 has to be hunted right off the get go.&#xA0; And the<br>Chapter 5 monsters are in an area that isn't accessible at the start.</p><p>About Quests:<br>Some quests will carry through multiple chapters, and they will appear within<br>this guide in each chapter with a note beside the quest name stated as (Ongoing<br>Quest).&#xA0; Also, there are a few quests that will or won't be available depending<br>on which allegiance has been made or if neutral.&#xA0; These will also be detailed as<br>such in paranthesis beside the quest name.&#xA0; There are other quests that will or<br>won't be available simply based on decisions made and the times these quests are<br>started. Any detriments will be pointed out as such.</p><p>Quests enclosed with * have some weight on alliances within the game, while<br>others can greatly affect who and what can be done.&#xA0; Taking a choice in one<br>path may make it impossible to do a certain quest, or it will alienate Geralt<br>from other characters. So if uncertain about a given outcome, or if the need<br>to give both paths a try is desired, save often and in different areas.<br>Remember, The Witcher does autosave, but there are only so many created and<br>the game will erase previous ones once it reaches about 4, so don't rely on<br>autosaves as a backup.</p><p>Quests are listed alphabetically by chapter and name as they appear in the<br>Journal.&#xA0; Its pretty much impossible to list them in the order they come<br>because quest steps can be skipped, entire quests can be passed over, and<br>depending on choices made there are some quests that simply aren't available.</p><p>There is an invaluable tool when doing quests.&#xA0; Open the Journal and choose<br>Quests if on a different page such as Characters or Formulas.&#xA0; Highlight a<br>quest and in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, "Track Quest on Map"<br>may be visible.&#xA0; Most quests have this and I'll be refering to it as Quest<br>Track throughout this guide.&#xA0; It can lead to people and places needed, but it<br>can only be used for one quest at a time.&#xA0; The map can also be used and points<br>of interest shown with dots can be located in the same manner by selecting the<br>given point.&#xA0; However, it is not possible to track a quest and a point of<br>interest on the map at the same time.</p><p>About Sex Cards:<br>Throughout the game, certain females Geralt comes in contact with can be<br>coerced into sex.&#xA0; Some of them that are related to quests or can be bedded in <br>the duration of a quest are listed in the given area.&#xA0; It is impossible to get<br>them all in one game.&#xA0; There are two in chapter 3 but only one of those two will<br>sleep with you.&#xA0; There are 3 in chapter 5, but once again, it is only possible<br>to sleep with 1 because they are dependent on your alliance or neutrality.<br>What should be a full list is included at the end of this FAQ.</p><p>About Dice Poker:<br>Dice poker is a great way to make money.&#xA0; Its also a terrific way to lose<br>money. A dice poker match is fairly simple.&#xA0; It starts out with an opening bet,<br>and depending on the opponent, the maximum bet can vary widely.&#xA0; One player may<br>only allow a maximum starting bet of ten, but another will allow a starting bet<br>of 110.&#xA0; After the opening roll, there is an option to raise.&#xA0; The minumum<br>amount that can be raised is 0 and the maximum widely varies based on opponent.<br>And in some circumstances, the opponent can raise, at which point, three options<br>are available.&#xA0; First available is to meet the opponents raise, second is a<br>medium raise, and last is a maximum raise, usually much higher than the medium.<br>There is also the option to pass, which is the same as folding giving the win<br>for that hand to the opponent.&#xA0; After the raise, there's a chance to reroll<br>anywhere from no dice (stand) to all five.&#xA0; Naturally, the opponent also gets<br>the same option.&#xA0; The player that wins two out of three games takes the pot.</p><p>The people available to play against have a limited amount of money on them at<br>any given time.&#xA0; So it may only be possible to win 300 orens against one<br>particular opponent, but in order to win more, they'll need to be left alone.<br>This can be done by entering a house or another area and then coming back.&#xA0; If<br>an opponent loses say 200 but they have a maximum of 300, then they can be<br>played a second time directly afterwards in most instances, but the maximum<br>raise allowed will be considerably lower.</p><p>This is a run down of poker hands.&#xA0; It runs in ascending order from nothing to<br>the best possible, which is five of a kind.&#xA0; I've placed the order below from<br>worst to best with a description of the hand.&#xA0; Why is there a description?<br>Because even though some people may know what a flush is, there are others<br>that don't. </p><p>&gt;Nothing - Jumbled hand where nothing matches such as 6, 5, 3, 2, and 1<br>&gt;Pair - a hand with two like dice amounts and the rest a jumble such as<br>6, 5, 5, 2, and 1<br>&gt;Two pair - a hand with two sets of like dice amounts and an off number such<br>as 6, 6, 3, 2, and 3<br>&gt;Three of a kind - a hand with three like amounts and two off numbers such as<br>5, 5, 4, 5, and 1<br>&gt;Five-high straight - a hand that runs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5<br>&gt;Six-high straight - a hand that runs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6<br>&gt;Full house - a hand with a combination of three of a kind and a pair such<br>as 3, 3, 3, 1, and 1<br>&gt;Four of a kind - four like amounts with an off number such as 4, 4, 4, 4<br>and 2<br>&gt;Five of a kind - all dice are the same denomination such as 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2</p><p>Just like normal card poker, a pair of 3's will lose to a pair of 5's.&#xA0; The <br>same goes for three of a kind and the like.&#xA0; If both players roll 2 pair, the<br>person with the highest pair wins.&#xA0; So even if one player rolls 5, 5, 4, 4, and<br>1 while the other player rolls 6, 6, 1, 1, and 2, the player with the pair of<br>6's wins.&#xA0; If a five-high straight is rolled and the other player manages a six<br>-high straight, the 5-high loses.&#xA0; Also, if a full house with 2 three's and 3<br>two's is rolled while the opponent manages a full house with 3 three's and 2<br>two's, the win goes to the person with three 3's.&#xA0; There may come a time when a<br>draw occurs.&#xA0; In the event that happens, neither player will get credit for the<br>match and it will continue until someone wins two out of three games.&#xA0; A draw<br>does not happen often and will usually only be seen with a straight.</p><p>Now for a little info on the AI poker player.&#xA0; If the computer controlled<br>opponent gets a straight or a full house, it is not likely they will reroll<br>unless the opposing hand is better.&#xA0; So on the opening hand, if the npc manages<br>a five-high straight, but Geralt only has a pair, a six-high straight or better<br>will be needed to win.&#xA0; A five-high straight will tie him and neither player<br>will get a point for the match.&#xA0; If a pair of five's is rolled and the computer<br>rolls a pair of six's, don't get frustrated.&#xA0; Most often, they will reroll one<br>of those comprising their pair.&#xA0; If the computer rolls a five-high straight in<br>their opening hand and something higher like a six-high straight is rolled, the<br>AI will either reroll their entire hand or simply concede the hand completely.<br>The same tends to go for a flush. If both players manage a flush on the opening<br>roll, but the AI is lower, they will either reroll the entire hand or simply<br>concede it.</p><p>About Intoxication:<br>The Witcher allows for many instances of drunken conduct. Usually, its more<br>annoying than anything because on a few occasions, there is no way around<br>getting hammered.&#xA0; The reason its annoying is it blurs vision and Geralt<br>staggers at about a quarter of the speed he normally moves at. So naturally it<br>takes quite a long time to get anywhere. The walking problem can be somewhat<br>counteracted by drawing a weapon if possible. This will put Geralt into combat<br>speed regardless of his level of inebriation. But fighting drunk is not a good<br>idea.&#xA0; When drunk, a yellow icon will show below the witcher emblem. The chance<br>to hit when drunk lowers dramatically and damage output also goes down.</p><p>There is a limit to how drunk Geralt can be before passing out.&#xA0; If Geralt does<br>happen to pass out, he will wind up lying in the dirt somwhere.&#xA0; That's not<br>bad, what is bad is that his wallet will be dramatically lighter.&#xA0; More than a<br>1000 orens can be lost by passing out.&#xA0; So before taking anyone on in some<br>drinking, best to save first.</p><p>There is a remedy to intoxication that can be picked up in Chapter 3. While at<br>the New Narakort, talk to the waitress numerous times.&#xA0; At some point, she is<br>going to groan that she ruined some gloves.&#xA0; Give her a pair of red gloves or<br>100 orens and she'll give over the recipe for wive's tears which automatically<br>cures all intoxication.&#xA0; She may also ask if Geralt has had too much to drink.<br>Go along with her dialogue and keep responding that she isn't boring. At the end<br>of it, Geralt will have the wive's tears recipe.</p><p>About potions:<br>There are numerous choices for potion crafting when it comes to ingredients.<br>The main thing that arises is figuring out what the ingredient means when it<br>says something like Vermilion and then below that it says Albedo. This Albedo<br>is a primary substance. Mixing potions together with a primary substance can<br>yeild a potion that states something to the terms of: Contains albedo as its<br>dominant substance. When that potion is imbibed, a secondary effect will occur<br>along with the normal potion effect.&#xA0; In order to get a dominant substance, a<br>potion must be mixed with a primary substance contained in all of its reagents.<br>Mixing 2 or 3 primary ingredients of differing kinds will yeild a standard<br>potion.</p><p>Example:&#xA0; The Swallow Potion requires 1 vitriol, 2 rebis, and 1 aether.&#xA0; If<br>mixing a vitriol containing albedo with 2 rebis of which both contain nigredo<br>and an aether containing rubedo, a standard swallow potion will be yeilded.<br>However, if mixing a vitriol containing rubedo, with 2 rebis that also contain<br>rubedo followed by an aether containing rubedo, the result will be a swallow<br>potion with the dominant substance rubedo.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that white gull can also be mixed to contain<br>a dominant substance and it can be used as a potion base.&#xA0; If it has a dominant<br>substance, the rest of the ingredients need to match that or a normal potion<br>will be yeilded.&#xA0; If it contains no dominant substance while the rest of<br>ingredients all contain say rubedo, then a potion containing rubedo will be<br>yeilded.</p><p>There are 3 primary substances to ingredients.&#xA0; Listed below are what they are<br>and what they do in potions when dominant.<br>Albedo - Reduces toxicity of consumed potions &gt; lasts 1 hour<br>Nigredo - Increases damage inflicted by 20% &gt; lasts 4 hours<br>Rubedo - Accelerates regeneration of Vitality &gt; lasts 4 hours</p><p>===============================================================================<br>Prologue+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>===============================================================================</p><p>A POTION FOR TRISS<br>-Started by Vesemir after the labratory is ransacked.<br>-First stop is upstairs at the kitchen where Lambert is.&#xA0; After he gives<br>instructions on the potion, go into the kitchen and out the rear door.&#xA0; Quest<br>Track will lead.&#xA0; Head up the stairs killing any bandits in the way.&#xA0; Once<br>upstairs, slay all the bandits to update.&#xA0; Now to loot all the rooms to get the<br>required materials.&#xA0; One of them is in the Evening Hall which is at the far end<br>on the left.&#xA0; The white gull is in a box in the room right past the Evening<br>Hall.&#xA0; Once those have been acquired, go back downstairs to the fireplace to<br>talk to Lambert.<br>-After chatting with Lambert, he'll give up the recipe for the potion along with<br>a few ingredient definitions.&#xA0; He'll instruct Geralt to see Vesemir, who may or<br>may not be present.&#xA0; If he isn't around, go toward the front door.&#xA0; That's where<br>he'll be coming from. Talk to him and he'll fork over one of the ingredients and<br>say the other is on the frightener outside.&#xA0; Selecting all his chat also opens<br>up "Berengar's Secret".<br>-After the heart to heart with Vesimir, run outside and open the dead frightener<br>up. Loot the claw and the eye along with anything else lying around and then go<br>back inside to talk to Vesemir again.&#xA0; After asking where the others are and<br>telling him the ingredients are ready, click the fireplace to begin meditation<br>and then select the bottle off the top right to pull up the formula and<br>combination window.&#xA0; Select Potion for Triss.&#xA0; It should be the only thing able<br>to be made.&#xA0; Highlight it and then select mix from the bottom right.<br>-Geralt is required to meditate for an hour after an alchemy combine.&#xA0; Once<br>finished with the potion and meditation, take it up to Triss.&#xA0; Quest Track will<br>show the way but its upstairs through the kitchen on the second floor.&#xA0; The door<br>to her room is directly across the hall from the library.&#xA0; Feel free to stop<br>and talk to Eskel and Lambert in the Armory and Evening Hall respectively. Both<br>have interesting things to say.<br>-When ready to move on, head upstairs to Triss' room.&#xA0; She'll be in bed nursing<br>her wounds.&#xA0; Click on her and a window with a little package that resembles a<br>wrapped birthday gift opens at the bottom of the screen.&#xA0; Select it to open the<br>gift window and drag the potion from quest items to the hand or double click it.<br>This will start a conversation with her and an opportunity for the first sex<br>card arises.&#xA0; When the option presents itself, select "I suppose we could...".<br>Then choose the top option again about how she helped out.<br>-This quest is now done.</p><p>BERENGAR'S SECRET<br>-This quest is started by Vesemir and it will progress through all chapters up<br>till 5.</p><p>DEFENDING KAER MORHEN<br>-First quest and fairly easy.&#xA0; If this is the first time playing and tutorial is<br>on, the game will guide most of this.&#xA0; But anyway, just follow everyone else for<br>now.&#xA0; Lambert will blast the rubble out of the way to advance.&#xA0; Once at the top,<br>its a loner mission and the opportunity to learn the combat styles of strong and<br>fast.<br>-Head up the ramp and slay whatever is found along the way.&#xA0; The objective is<br>the very top of the wall.<br>-Once around the top wall, there will be a group of archers and others next to a<br>large pot off to the right, down a set of stairs.&#xA0; Forget about them and head<br>for the circular tower directly ahead.&#xA0; This gives a cut-scene and seperates<br>Geralt from those following.<br>-Head to the right toward the gate.&#xA0; Ignore the siege cauldrons and bell.<br>There's nothing that can be done with those right now.&#xA0; Slay the bandits in the<br>way and push ahead for the gate.&#xA0; After slaying all the bandits, operate the<br>wench and start the next portion.<br>-Follow Leo to the citadel entrance.&#xA0; Leo is going to say to drink the<br>thunderbolt potion and that must be done before the doors will open.&#xA0; So suck<br>it down and head inside.<br>-Head straight back, dispatching the bandits.&#xA0; Loot their bodies when possible<br>and don't bother with the Kitchen yet.&#xA0; Its locked.&#xA0; Just follow Leo.&#xA0; Once in<br>the labratory, a cut-scene interrupts and then Leo leads to the first sign,<br>Aard.&#xA0; Touching the monolith a second time will give an affect that will<br>bolster that particular sign, and then loot the trunk.&#xA0; There is another trunk<br>to loot along the wall, between the blocked portion of the lab and the magic<br>circle.&#xA0; Blast the collapsed wall and head upstairs.<br>-The first choice in the game is coming.&#xA0; Either go with Triss, or fight the<br>frightener.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If going with Triss, Geralt will be forced back inside the citadel.<br>First boss fight with a mage is coming.&#xA0; Drink the swallow potion if its still<br>in inventory.&#xA0; The mage is sort of annoying because he's linked to a few other<br>bandits and they have to be killed before the mage can be hit.&#xA0; He'll also<br>teleport around once his barrier is down, breaking chain attacks.&#xA0; Once he's<br>dead, go around the corner to find Triss sprawled out on the floor. Go down to<br>the lab for a tragic cut-scene.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If the choice was to take on the frightener, things get interesting.<br>Immediately take the tawny owl potion because Aard is going to play a big part<br>of this fight.&#xA0; Also suck down the swallow potion if its still in inventory.<br>There will be a half a dozen bandits along with the frightener. Use group style<br>attack if swarmed by more than 1 bandit, but stay away from the frightener.<br>Once the bandits are dead, run to a siege cauldron and hit it with Aard.<br>Immediately run to the other and hit it as well. Ring the little bell and the<br>frightener should go into a daze. As soon as it does, open up on it with strong<br>style. When the siege cauldrons stop ringing and the frightener comes out of<br>its stupor, go hit the cauldrons again with Aard to daze it. Run back in and<br>light it up with strong style again.&#xA0; Do not take on the frightener without<br>dazing it.&#xA0; If it knocks Geralt down with bandits around, they will one shot<br>kill. The frightener will also one shot kill if it gets Geralt down. It also<br>hits pretty hard. After the frightener goes down, Geralt and Leo will<br>immediately be transported to the labratory.&#xA0; Watch the tragic little cut scene.</p><p>-Once done meditating and dishing out any points, hit up the wardrobe for some<br>swallow potions and head toward the stairs. Vesemir will give a new quest on<br>the way out, "A Potion for Triss".<br>-Next objective is to make sure everyone else is all right.&#xA0; Actually can't<br>accomplish this until finished with "A Potion for Triss" and its been given to<br>her. So refer to that for now.<br>-Eventually a prompt to meet Vesemir is given by Triss.&#xA0; Question her about<br>everything else first. If there was anything that caught some attention, do<br>that now before meeting with him.&#xA0; Once the meeting with Vesimir begins, a cut<br>scene will play and this chapter finishes.</p><p>================================================================================<br>chapter 1+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>================================================================================<br>Couple things to do off the get-go. Take a Barghest skull and a beast tooth<br>and go see the Innkeeper to store them.&#xA0; Both are used in a quest later on in<br>chapter 3 and barghest's are only available for their heads in this chapter.<br>The beast teeth can be acquired from dogs, wolves, and a few other monsters<br>later on, but its best to just store one in case of unforseen circumstances.<br>Also, get herblism as soon as possible.&#xA0; It will be needed for a quest and it<br>comes in very useful later on for ingredients to make potions, bombs, and oils.<br>And the last thing is to get the contracts from the Notice Board. The quests<br>off the Notice Board should be one of the first things done every chapter. Read <br>them to get their quests and then drop them on the ground. Only the quest is<br>needed and they'll eat up space they don't need to in inventory.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;+Monster Hunts+</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;KING OF THE CRYPT<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Ozzrel can be found in the very back of the crypt on the right side<br>after completing "Buried Memories".&#xA0; A wall will need to be blown down with Aard<br>to get to him.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-This guy can be nasty.&#xA0; He hits very hard so come prepared with some<br>swallow.&#xA0; Tawny owl is another good idea to force him off with Aard and possibly<br>score a knockdown for a one hit death.&#xA0; If health is running low, back him off<br>with Aard and then turn and run the other way.&#xA0; Swallow should fill health up<br>rather fast, so use hit and run tactics if need be with strong style.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Once his head dangles from Geralt's waist, travel it over to the Royal<br>Huntsman to collect a 200 oren fee.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;THE MONSTER OF THE LAKE<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Nadir can be found just past the mill between the main Vizima gates.<br>There is a very large group of drowners near him, but if careful, he can be<br>pulled away from them becasue he tends to roam onto land opposed to the drowners<br>that stay in the water.&#xA0; Simply edge closer till the left side of the screen<br>turns red showing combat has begun with Nadir and then move back.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-It doesn't take a lot to put Nadir down, but he does hit rather hard.<br>Fast style is preferred for him because even though a few hits with strong may<br>land, he'll dodge them more often than not.&#xA0; Aard is also good, knocking him<br>down and giving time to start a chain. Once his head has taken leave of his<br>body, take it over to the Royal Huntsman for the 200 oren reward.&#xA0; He can be<br>found a little west of the Inn along the path or just use Quest Track.</p><p>A GAME OF DICE<br>-This can be started a number of ways. The first way is by taking a Dice Box<br>from a traveler killed during "Racists".&#xA0; If no help was given to the dwarf, or<br>simply haven't come to that part by some strange means, a dice box can also be<br>acquired from a corpse in the crypt during "Buried Memories". The last and not<br>so popular way is to completely skip it during this chapter. However, there is<br>a forced match in chapter 2 so its best to just start now.&#xA0; Besides, its a<br>great way to earn cash for herb books, monster lore, weapons, and armor<br>considering the first and only piece of armor available till chapter 5 costs<br>5000 orens.<br>-The first thing to do after getting a dice box is go to the Inn and talk to<br>Zoltan Chivay about it.&#xA0; It will start this quest that will run clear up till<br>Chapter 5.<br>-Talk to Zoltan and he'll play a game of dice.&#xA0; Then talk to him again and ask<br>if he can play for serious money.&#xA0; He'll say that Odo, Mikul and Haren all<br>play.<br>-Now with the formalities out of the way, a minor choice needs to be made.<br>There are 4 players available in this chapter, but only 3 need beat.&#xA0; Its not<br>much of a decision and money can be won from them all.&#xA0; The players that can be<br>challenged are: Zoltan, Mikul, Haren, and Odo.&#xA0; Any three will suffice and<br>complete this portion of the quest.&#xA0; However, to play Mikul, Haren, and Odo the<br>ring of eternal fire needs to be obtained from the Reverend by asking about<br>salamandra.<br>-Once the three victims have been chosen and beaten, this quest is done till<br>chapter 2.&#xA0; Any dice playing done till next chapter is strictly for fun and<br>personal gain, or possibly loss.</p><p>BERENGAR'S SECRET (Ongoing Quest)<br>-First update will come from the Reverend.</p><p>BURIED MEMORIES<br>-Starts from Mikul at Vizima gates.&#xA0; Show him the signet of eternal fire the<br>Reverend gave and offer some witcher services.<br>-The crypt can be a nasty place. Lots of ghouls and very dark, so whip up a cat<br>potion and swallow potion before going in.&#xA0; Also, make sure to have ghoul entry<br>in the bestiary.&#xA0; It can be acquired in 3 different ways.&#xA0; First, buy it from<br>the antiquary that frequents the Inn.&#xA0; Second, spend a bronze tablet on Monster<br>Lore in the intelligence tree.&#xA0; The last and cheapest way is to find the<br>Drunkard at the Inn and challenge him to a drinking game.&#xA0; He'll fork over a<br>monster book for ghouls to read.&#xA0; The reason for getting this is because<br>Kalkstein wants ghoul parts and there's nowhere else that will have as many<br>ghouls as the crypt.<br>-Once inside, take the cat potion and a swallow potion.&#xA0; There's a dead girl<br>right at the entrance that seems to have drawn the ghouls. Take the potion vial<br>next to her body.&#xA0; It'll come in handy later and leads to plot development.<br>-While fighting, its wise to pull the ghouls back a bit when encountered. They<br>pop out of the ground, so as one is forced back with chain attacks, there is a<br>possibility of getting a few more during the fight. Strong style works well<br>against them.<br>-There's not a lot to do in here, but the second sign, Igni, can be acquired.<br>It is very handy for a quest later on. The dice box to start "A Game of Dice"<br>can also be picked up from a corpse, though if Geralt already has one, there's<br>no need to loot it.<br>-When going back to Mikul for the turn in, several salamandra will show up at<br>the bridge.&#xA0; After killing them, depending on which path was taken at Kaer<br>Morhen, one of two cut-scenes will show. Once back in control, loot the bodies.<br>There will likely be 2 or 3 salamandra badges on them. Keep these, they'll be<br>used later on. Talk to Mikul to inform him of the completed task. He'll say as<br>a side thought that some of the boys planned to search for treasure. Now the<br>place is open to search further back in because a couple guards took some pick-<br>axes to the rubble that was blocking the path. This opens the way for "King of<br>the Crypt" monster hunt.&#xA0; He'll also ramble on about his love Ilsa. She's the<br>dead girl that drew the ghouls.&#xA0; And this quest is now done.</p><p>DEAD HAND OF THE PAST<br>-This quest starts from Declan Leuvaarden at the Inn.&#xA0; He can be found inside<br>during the day.<br>-He wants a missing friend found. The cave he's talking about is to the left of<br>the castle gates along the river.&#xA0; Its a nasty place with several echinops<br>inside.&#xA0; Having Igni helps a great deal on them.&#xA0; Save before entering.<br>-The echinops are large plants that will smack and shoot.&#xA0; Strong style works<br>well on them as does Igni.&#xA0; NOTE: If not running patch 1.3, then Geralt must be<br>manually moved within striking distance.&#xA0; Anything before 1.3 and clicking on<br>the plant will do simply nothing as Geralt will be outside actual striking<br>range.&#xA0; So if he's not hitting them, manually move another step or two closer.<br>-The goal is to find and kill the Sated Echinops. Move slow, because these<br>things pop out of the ground.&#xA0; They don't move, but can and will use ranged<br>attacks.&#xA0; The sated is roughly between the rock column and the pile of fallen<br>stones.<br>-The sated echinops will hit a bit harder than the normal ones, but its still<br>the same in terms of combat.&#xA0; Get in close and use strong style.&#xA0; If an attack<br>chain breaks, toss out an Igni and start meleeing again.&#xA0; Shouldn't take but a<br>few seconds to kill it.&#xA0; If there are two or three other echinops shooting and<br>health is plummeting, run back to the entrance and take a rest.&#xA0; Once its dead,<br>loot the skull from it and head back to Declan at the Inn.<br>-Declan refuses to pay because technically, the agreement isn't finished.&#xA0; If<br>his friend was found dead, the circumstances were to bury him.&#xA0; So, now off to<br>see the Reverend about getting Declan's good friend laid to rest in a more<br>appropriate place than the belly of a plant.<br>-After asking for permission to bury the body, head into the chapel and<br>downstairs.&#xA0; A nasty little surprise is waiting once the skull is put in the<br>crypt.&#xA0; This will be the first encounter with King of the Wild Hunt. It doesn't<br>matter how he's answered.&#xA0; Once he vanishes, a fight with a familiar ghost<br>ensues. The ghost is nothing to worry about, just use fast style on him and<br>he'll go down rather quickly.&#xA0; Be sure to loot him after he's dead since he's<br>carrying a piece of meteorite ore.<br>-Head back to Declan at the Inn once the apparition has been put down like a<br>lame horse.</p><p>Dice Poker: The Novice<br>-Starts when taking on Mikul, Haren, Odo, or Zoltan<br>-Three of the four people listed need to be beaten in order to progress.</p><p>FISTFIGHT<br>-Starts by having a fight with Fat Fred at the Inn.&#xA0; This quest runs clear<br>through chapter 5 and is required for another quest.<br>-Talk to Fat Fred and give up 25 orens. After beating him, there's a choice of:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-a ring &gt; gold diamond ring that sells for 120 orens<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-vodka and chaser<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-cash &gt; 100 orens plus the 25 wagered<br>-After beating Fat Fred, this quest is done till the next chapter.</p><p>HOT POTATO<br>-This quest can be gotten from Haren after finishing "Strangers in the Night".<br>-The objective is to take a package to Coleman at the Hairy Bear Inn.&#xA0; Nothing<br>that can be done till the next chapter, so throw this on the back burner for<br>now.</p><p>* OF MONSTERS AND MEN *<br>-This quest starts at the beginning of the chapter.<br>-Talk to the Reverend to progress. He is roughly on the opposite side of the<br>map.<br>-He gives the task of lighting the 5 fire shrines throughout the village. Quest<br>Track will show the way to them and they can only be lit at night. Also, upon<br>arriving at each one to light it, barghests will pop up, anywhere from 2 to 4.<br>Once they're lit, head back to the Reverend. He can be found outside the church<br>during the day or in his house at night which is right next to the church.<br>-After lighting all the eternal fire altars and returning for the reward, the<br>Reverend starts pointing the finger at Abigail. So time to go visit her to see<br>what she has to say.<br>-Abigail has no idea where the beast came from, but she thinks Alvin might. So<br>now comes the part of harvesting plants. If unable to do so, go work on<br>another quest to get a level and spend a bronze tablet in that ability from the<br>intelligence line. 5 white myrtle petals are needed from the surrounding plant<br>life.&#xA0; On a side note, buy the specter oil from Abigail, or if Geralt has the<br>oil making ability, make a vial or two. It'll come in handy for a fight at the<br>end of the chapter.<br>-After gathering the petals, giving them to Abigail and listening to Alvin go<br>all demon-boy, head back to the Reverend. After the turn in to the Reverend,<br>this is done for a while. At least until the tasks given by Odo, Haren, and<br>Mikul are finished.<br>-Once the end of the chapter draws near and the children are found in the<br>caves, Geralt will run into Abigail. Turns out the town has decided to have a<br>fire with Abigail as the kindling. During the talk with her, a choice to talk<br>to the townspeople or get to know her better will come up.&#xA0; Chose to know her<br>better to recieve her sex card, which is a little frightening actually. This is<br>the only time its possible to get her card. Before leaving the cave, apply some<br>specter oil. Don't bother with drinking a tawny owl or a swallow potion yet. The<br>game has a tendency to remove their effects between the cut scene.<br>-Now comes the part that will effect other portions of the game. If siding<br>with Abigail, the help of the villagers during the fight with the beast is<br>lost and she'll show up later in the game. If siding with the townsfolk,<br>Abigail is dead so she doesn't help during the fight with the beast, and her<br>help much later in the game during the epilogue is lost. Not helping her can<br>also affect a quest in chapter 4.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Fighting the beast with Abigail can be a bit difficult at times even<br>though she will periodically heal. As soon as the fight starts, two or three<br>barghest are going to go after her.&#xA0; Peel them off as quick as possible.&#xA0; If she<br>gets hit too much, she'll be knocked down and there will be no healing from her<br>till she gets back up, which can take a long time.&#xA0; So go group style until all<br>the barghests are dead, leaving only the beast.&#xA0; If Geralt's blade is treated<br>with specter oil, they should go down in 2 or 3 swings.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If fighting the beast with the villagers, they'll draw the attention of<br>nearly all the barghests so Geralt can concentrate on the beast alone for a few.<br>Be wary, unlike the fight with Abigail, it is possible to attack the villagers<br>and if even 1 of them is attacked, they will all turn on Geralt.</p><p>-Fighting the beast can be tricky.&#xA0; He has a tendency to cause pain, which<br>pretty much stuns and leaves Geralt defenseless. Also, running into the fire<br>encircling everything will cause incineration which deals damage and leaves<br>Geralt unable to move and completely vulnerable to the beast and barghests. If<br>health becomes an issue, run in circles near the perimeter to allow swallow<br>time to work its magic and fill vitality back up. Also, if some points have<br>been spent in Aard, there's a good chance it will stun or knockdown the beast,<br>allowing a one hit instant kill. When the beast dies, so do any other barghests<br>running around.<br>-When the beast is finally dead a few things can happen depending on choices<br>made.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If Abigail was left to the wicked ways of the villagers, the reverend<br>comes to visit.&#xA0; Now another choice comes.&#xA0; Get the permit to enter the city<br>from him willingly, or take it from his corpse.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If Abigail was protected from the villagers, Odo, Haren, and the<br>Reverend come for a friendly visit. Kill them all and take the permit from the<br>priest's lifeless body.<br>-Be sure to loot the beast's body for his hellhound soul that can be used in a<br>potion.&#xA0; After all choices have been made and bodies pile up like bricks, this<br>quest finishes and the end of the chapter picks up with the quest "The<br>Salamander's Tail".&#xA0; Also, If Abigail was left to fend for herself, go back to<br>the cave that's just down the road and loot some things from her remains</p><p>RACISTS<br>-Starts by helping Zoltan Chivay when he's surrounded by 4 travelers.<br>-Tell the travelers to move along and then kill them.<br>-After killing the travelers and talking to Zoltan, who actually knows Geralt,<br>this quest finishes.</p><p>SHE'S NO EARLY BIRD<br>-This quest starts from Vesna.&#xA0; Find her at the town sign just outside of the<br>Inn fort at midnight. She'll be surrounded by bandits.&#xA0; When prompted, answer<br>with "You'll lose those shortly..." which leads to killing the entire group.<br>Then agree to walk her home.&#xA0; Use Quest Track to find it.<br>-While taking her home, groups of barghests will pop up to impede the journey.<br>Use group style to get rid of them and continue on.&#xA0; Once back at her home,<br>she'll ask how she can possibly say thanks.&#xA0; If wanting her sex card, answer<br>with meeting her again.&#xA0; Wait till dusk of the next day and show up at the old<br>mill with a bottle of wine.&#xA0; Her sex scene is actually quite funny. Regardless<br>of the choice, this quest will finish.</p><p>* STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT *<br>-Starts from Haren Brogg after getting the ring of eternal fire from the<br>Reverend.<br>-This quest can affect 2 other quests in Chapter 2.<br>-Go out to the water next to Haren's hut where all the parcels, jars, and boxes<br>are sitting next to the overturned boat at night. Kill off about a half a dozen<br>drowners.<br>-When the drowners are dead, Some elves will approach. Now if Geralt lets the<br>elves take what they want, "Hot Potato" will be put on a trigger, as well<br>as "The Rat" in chapter 2. Both quests need to be finished before speaking to<br>Raymond otherwise the npc needed is killed.<br>-After the decision is made to give the elves the goods or to kill them, head<br>back in to give Haren the news and collect the reward. Then talk to him again<br>about more work and he'll give the quest "Hot Potato".</p><p>THE BARGHEST CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Abigail, the town witch, wants 10 barghest heads. These little critters pop up<br>all over the place in town at night.<br>-Once ten have been acquired, which should take no time at all, head over to her<br>hut. She will also buy any and all barghest heads after turning this quest in.</p><p>THE DROWNER CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-The Reverend wants 3 drowner brains. They can be found at just about any body<br>of water at night.<br>-Once three are packed away, take them to the Reverend who is out front of the<br>church in the day or in his house at night.</p><p>THE GHOUL CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Kalkstein wants three vials of ghoul blood. Ghouls can be found in a number of<br>places.&#xA0; Sometimes they are roaming the villages near the Inn at night, a few<br>can be found in abandoned huts, but the majority will be in the crypt where<br>"Buried Memories" takes place.&#xA0; Just remember, components for this quest cannot<br>be secured from their bodies if the ghoul entry isn't in the bestiary. There<br>are three ways to get it.&#xA0; The first is by spending a bronze tablet in the<br>intelligence tree for Monster Lore.&#xA0; The second way is going to cost 250 gold<br>and that is by buying it from the Antiquary at the Inn.&#xA0; The third way is by<br>outdrinking the Drunkard at the Inn.&#xA0; Toussaint red works and upwards of 9 can<br>be found while looting houses and such throughout the village. It should only<br>take around 3 or 4 before he caves in.&#xA0; Once the win is in the bag, he'll give<br>The Tome of Fear and Loathing, volume 1.&#xA0; Depending on which method was chosen,<br>the antiquary can be found sitting around the tables at the inn about anytime<br>during the day, and the drunkard is around in the evening.<br>-Once the blood is collected, find Kalkstein at the Inn.&#xA0; If this quest is done<br>when going for the turn in to "Buried Memories", the reward can be collected<br>from Kalkstien at the gate.</p><p>THE SALAMANDER'S TAIL<br>-This quest starts at the beginning of the chapter.<br>-Talk to the Reverend.&#xA0; He is roughly on the opposite side of the map.<br>-Updates to this come after helping Haren, Mikul, and Odo.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: When going to ask the Reverend about Salamandra after finishing<br>the quests given by Odo, Haren, and Mikul, things will be sped along to end the<br>chapter. So be sure everything else is done.&#xA0; Go see Abigail and buy some<br>specter oil, or if possible, make some. This will come in very handy when<br>taking on the beast.&#xA0; Its also a good idea to hunt the two unique monsters and<br>to store a barghest head if they haven't been done.&#xA0; Also, sell any other<br>barghest heads to Abigail. This is the last chance before talking to the<br>Reverend.</p><p>-Tell the Rev about the completed tasks done for the others and he'll say he<br>isn't talking until the beast is dead.&#xA0; Argue that wasn't part of the agreement,<br>then he'll say Innkeeper Olaf supposedly has a key for the Salamandra base.<br>-Once inside the Inn, cute little Shani is surrounded by men that mean to do all<br>sorts of interesting and probably taboo things to her. So time to intervene<br>and rescue the damsel in distress.<br>-After violently imposing some authority upon the would-be rapists, go check out<br>the cooling corpse of Olaf. He'll have a key that will point toward the<br>salamander base.&#xA0; Its roughly to the west. Very hard to miss because there<br>will be 2 salamandra lackey's right out front. Drink a swallow potion before<br>going into the hut because 4 more thugs will be waiting to swarm like bees.<br>Group steel works well to thin their ranks. Aard can also give some breathing<br>room and most likely, at least 1 will be stunned or knocked down for an instant<br>kill.<br>-Once downstairs in the cave, fight some more salamandra goons that actually<br>seem a bit afraid. Depending on what path was taken in Kaer Morhen, there may<br>be some of the equipment from the lab sitting around.&#xA0; "Berengar's Secret" will<br>also update. Follow Alvin back once everything of value has been taken and<br>blast the wall down with Aard.&#xA0; At the back of the cave, the friendly<br>neighborhood witch, Abigail, is waiting. Chose to know her better for her sex<br>card.<br>-After killing the beast, hellhound soul stored in inventory, and letter of safe<br>conduct, go pick up Shani from the Inn.<br>-Once she's in tow, run to the gate Mikul is guarding.</p><p>THE SECRET GARDEN<br>-This quest is acquired from Odo after obtaining the eternal fire ring from the<br>Reverend.<br>-Odo needs some echinops cleared from his garden. A simple enough task at first<br>glance. The problem is, he gets Geralt drunk first in an attempt to lower the<br>bill for weeding his garden. And being drunk decreases hit percentage, combat<br>damage output, lowers walk speed, blurs vision, and is simply annoying overall.<br>The walking can be easily fixed by simply drawing a weapon.&#xA0; If Igni is<br>available, the fight should be a bit simpler.&#xA0; Use strong style and if missing<br>two or three times, smack it with some fire. There's only two plants to clear<br>and they are far enough away from one another that the second one won't be able<br>to range hit while the other is being killed. Just remember that if not playing<br>with patch 1.3, simply clicking to attack from a distance won't get Geralt close<br>enough.&#xA0; He'll need to be manually moved within striking distance.<br>-Once the echinops are dead, stumble back inside where Odo will try and cheat<br>Geralt! The nerve! Worry not though, he'll give up the full 100 orens.</p><p>WANTED<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Actually can't do anything with this quest yet.</p><p>WITCHERS' SECRETS<br>-This quest starts at the beginning of the chapter and progresses clear through<br>to the Epilogue.<br>-Talk to the most prominent members of the outskirts. The Reverend will be the<br>first stop and he will tell of the other three to see.<br>-After helping out Olaf, Mikul, and Haren, talk to the Reverend again and when<br>he tells of the salamanders taking over the Inn, an update finally occurs.<br>-Another update comes after talking to the Salamandra boss in the cave.</p><p>=======================================================<br>chapter 2++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>=======================================================<br>This starts on a down note with Geralt in jail.&#xA0; In order to progress, have a<br>chat with the Elven Convict and he'll give up a dice box and ask for a game of<br>dice poker.&#xA0; The most he has is about 30 orens. Now whether its a win or loss,<br>the Jailer Vincent will come in and say in order to go free, gotta kill a<br>cockatrice in the sewers.&#xA0; The catch to it is that first the Muscleman needs a<br>serious beat down in a fist fight. When finished speaking to Vincent, the<br>quest "Prison Break" starts.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;+Monster Hunts+</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;* THE BEAST OF THE SEWERS *<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The greater cockatrice is part of another quest, "Prison Break". It<br>can be found in the sewers in the south-western portion.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-After entering the sewers, a knight by the name of Seigfreid will ask <br>to come along. Deny him and the order armorer can't be used but he'll let Geralt<br>into the hospital free of charge. Allow him to tag along and the order armorer<br>will sell to Geralt. Seigfreid will also get Geralt into the Dike free of charge<br>but getting into the hospital will cost about 40 orens.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Not a difficult fight thankfully because Geralt will have next to <br>nothing aside from his belt slot item. Use fast style on the cockatrice and<br>after a few hits, smack it with Aard for a chance to either knock it down or<br>possibly stun him for a one swing kill. Take his head back to Vincent who will<br>either be in the dungeon or outside it for the reward of 400 orens.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;BLOODTHIRSTY VEGETATION<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The target for this hunt is an archespore called Coccacidium.&#xA0; It is<br>a much stronger version of an echinops and hits much harder. It can be found<br>in a number of places such as northwest of the clay pits in the swamp. Looking<br>at the map, it is where the two paths from the village and claypits meet. It<br>can also pop up outside of gramps' hut going toward the brickmaker village.<br>There are other places for it to attack from, and it will continue to do so<br>until its put down.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The fight with Coccacidium is actually quite tough. This plant hits<br>very hard and it can kill in a matter of moments if Geralt's health isn't<br>watched. Strong style silver works best and Igni also does some good damage.<br>Blizzard will help to cut down on damage taken as well. If a chain attack is<br>broken, throw out an Igni and immediately start attacking again. If finding him<br>to be troublesome, its possible to come back later with a few more levels or<br>even more warriors once the quest "Force Recon" is started.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Once the over-powered plant is chopped down like Lincoln's cherry<br>tree, take its head/stalk back to Vincent for 400 orens.</p><p>A GAME OF DICE<br>-Now the option of taking on other opponents presents itself, commence with the<br>gambling.<br>-Carmen, the Gardener, and Vaska can progress the quest if still on novice.<br>-Munro Bruys or Thaler the fence will progress the quest if three novices were<br>beaten during the last chapter. Whichever one is visited first will end "Dice<br>Poker: The Novice" and start "Dice Poker: The Professional".</p><p>A GHOST STORY<br>-This quest starts from a Thug in the building directly across from the <br>warehouse near the Hairy Bear.<br>-Once inside, it seems the house isn't haunted at all...at least not yet.<br>There will be bodies shortly though.&#xA0; So, after a little amusing dialogue, and<br>the bodies hit the floor, chat with the half elf.&#xA0; She doesn't speak so well,<br>but the general idea gets across to visit her at home and this quest ends.</p><p>* A GRAVEDIGGER'S GRATITUDE *<br>-This quest doesn't affect allegiances, but it can affect several other quests<br>as well as how major events within this chapter play out once completed. So<br>its marked for that reason.<br>-This quest starts from the gravedigger after Raymond has run off to throw<br>salamandra from his trail and come back.<br>-He'll inform that in order to get in to the cemetary, a pass from Vincent is<br>needed, or get Thaler to clear his debts.<br>-So, take a trip on over to see Thaler. Unfortunately, Thaler won't clear the<br>debt or let it be bought off till he's proven innocent, which can't be done for <br>quite a while.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If looking to get the debt cleared, perform the autopsy as normal.<br>Afterwards, follow "Old Friend of Mine". Get Shani's sex card in order to clear<br>Thaler if his innocence isn't proven during the autopsy.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Go see Vincent if clearing the debt doesn't sound too favorable. By<br>now, Geralt should be on his good side. If Vincent hasn't yet been cleared of<br>any wrong doing, he won't give up the pass.<br>-Once inside the cemetary, head to the crypt. It will to the left near the<br>largest body of water. Lots of necrophages inside, so bring swallow potions,<br>tawny owls, a cat potion and necrophage oil if its available.<br>-Inside the crypt, the item needed to progress the quest is the first left.<br>Not exactly a smoking gun, but it clears all suspects. After getting the update,<br>search the rest of the crypt for loot, then go chat with the gravedigger.<br>After telling him what was found, this quest finishes.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Also, if the pass was obtained from Vincent, don't forget to head back<br>and let him know what was found.</p><p>A LONG WAY FROM HOME<br>-Starts from Yaren Bolt in the lumberjack clearing within the swamp forest after<br>finishing "Flowers and Gold"<br>-Yaren needs the road cleared and the vodyanoi dealt with. Put Quest Track on<br>because there are three places that need cleared of monsters.<br>-The first place is along the path just west of the cave.&#xA0; There are 3<br>bloedzuiger that want dead.<br>-The second area is east along the path that runs past the altar of melitele.<br>There are 3 drowners that require killing.<br>-The third area is just past the drowners running east and 2 echinapse need to<br>be trimmed.<br>-After those areas are cleared, the map is going to point toward the vodyanoi<br>shrine.&#xA0; Don't go that way.&#xA0; Go to Vaska's hut.<br>-Chat it up with Vaska to learn of a more civil manner, then head back to the<br>clearing and get Yaren's axe from him.&#xA0; The axe will occupy the secondary sword<br>slot. With the axe in hand, place it on the altar by the clay pits. Camp till<br>midnight and then go back. A vodyanoi amulet will be waiting in place of the<br>axe. Take the amulet back to Yaren Bolt for the 400 oren reward and quest<br>finish.</p><p>A LOST LAMB<br>-Started by Vaska in the swamp forest after finishing "Clay Pits"<br>-Vaska wants one of their children that has gone missing found.&#xA0; Being the<br>superstitious fool that she is, she thinks the druids stole him to turn him<br>into a dryad. So, druid grove in the northwestern portion is the first stop.<br>-The druids won't talk at night, so come back during the day. They'll say they<br>haven't seen the boy, but to talk to the dryad, Morenn.<br>-Morenn states that only females are able to be dryads and males are only taken<br>in to procreate. Now is the chance to get her sex card. She wants a wolf pelt<br>as a test of strength. So fork one over.&#xA0; If no wolf pelts populate inventory,<br>make a trip to the cave or hunt around the druid grove for some. After giving<br>her the pelt, she mentions that witcher's are sterile.&#xA0; So now onto convincing<br>her, which doesn't take much.&#xA0; Answer with "Intimacy without procreation can be<br>good." then answer with sex relieves stress.<br>-Once her card is secure, head back to Vaska to finish this quest for the time<br>being. It will pick back up in the next chapter.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Also, go into Vaska's house when everyone is praying and talk to the<br>men. One of them will offer 100 orens for looking for their missing boy.<br>Refuse the money and he'll teach Geralt the recipe for Perfume.</p><p>A MOST UNCOMMON WINE<br>-Obtained from Conrad who can be found frequenting the Hairy Bear in the<br>evenings.<br>-He wants some one hundred year-old-wine in an abandoned house that happens to<br>be guarded by Graviers. The house he's referring to is between Raymond's<br>place and the Dike entrance.&#xA0; Be wary, another quest entitled "The Rat" also<br>takes place inside.&#xA0; If "The Rat" is also active, 2 wraiths will be waiting just<br>inside to take a nibble off any visitors.&#xA0; If "The Rat" isn't active, there<br>won't be anything upstairs when entering.<br>-Head down to the basement to find 4 graviers. Slay them and take the 3 bottles<br>of wine from the crate on the floor.&#xA0; Now back to Conrad.<br>-Good old Conrad doesn't have the cash to pay for it.&#xA0; But for some strange<br>reason, he still thinks it would be a good idea to fork a bottle over after<br>risking death to obtain them. Obviously he's been drinking quite heavily. So<br>the options run as:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Give the lying lush a bottle.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The second choice is no money, no wine.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The last option is Geralt doesn't actually have them.<br>-Any choice will work, but why give him wine when he promised gold?&#xA0; Doesn't<br>matter what option is selected, quest still finishes.&#xA0; As a side note, the <br>wine sells to the waitress for 80 orens a pop, making a total of 240 orens. It<br>doesn't have any other use aside from drinking it.</p><p>A MYSTERIOUS TOWER<br>-This starts from Kalkstein.&#xA0; His house stands between Vivaldi's and Shani's.<br>-First is to get 2 books for him, Ain Soph Aur and The Secret Gates.&#xA0; There's<br>only 1 way to obtain The Secret Gates, but there's 2 ways to get Ain Soph Aur.<br>Regardless, first stop is the Antiquary.<br>-The antiquary will point toward Vivaldi. He also eludes to a hermit in the<br>swamp knowning something of Ain Soph Aur. So onward to Vivaldi.<br>-Now there are two ways this can go when going to see Vivaldi.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Just meet Vivaldi in his house and ask about the books, of which he has<br>both.&#xA0; The Secret Tower will run 100 orens while Ain Soph Aur will cost 300.<br>Can buy them both from him, or wait and get Ain Soph Aur totally free once<br>getting to the swamp. Breaks down to having the extra cash.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-There is the chance that Geralt will walk in on Vivaldi being arrested.<br>If so, the quest will shift to breaking the little dwarf out. So, go to the<br>dungeon and chat with the junkie-jailer Jethro.&#xA0; He'll let Vivaldi out if the<br>200 oren bail is posted.&#xA0; Naturally, cough up the cash. As Vivaldi comes out<br>of the cell, ask about the books.&#xA0; He'll be so grateful, he'll give up both<br>totally free.&#xA0; Read them, then go see Kalkstein.<br>-Kalkstein will rattle off about the obelisk's and hand over the Chocc'mah<br>Sephirah. He'll make notes for Geralt in the Glossary under "Kalkstein's<br>Notes". They'll tell about the Sephirah and where they can be found. Should<br>already have Maal'kad which the greater cockatrice was carrying. Now knowing<br>how to do this, head to Lebioda Hospital to pick up 3 more sephirah. Its quite<br>possible to already have them though. Target is the Melitele statue.&#xA0; There's<br>a nun beside it that will give some information on how to make an offering.<br>Give the statue some fruit to recieve Veen'ah, Ghe'vrath, and the 'Oth <br>Sephirah's.<br>-Now there are a few left to find.&#xA0; One is held by Vaska, Kezath, who can be<br>found in the swamp village.&#xA0; Another, Tipperath, is held by Declan Leuvaarden.<br>He can be found at the Dike and he's a bit on the greedy side.&#xA0; Bring 500 orens<br>when going to see him.&#xA0; Y'esath can be found in a cave in the swamp.&#xA0; Its near<br>the back in vran's sarcophagus.&#xA0; A wraith will be protecting it along with a<br>bunch of wolves.&#xA0; Neh'tza is also in the swamp, held at the golem burial ground<br>by the frozen golem.&#xA0; The last comes from an unlikely place...Detective Raymond.<br>-So first stop is Declan on the Dike.&#xA0; Give him 500 for Tipperath.&#xA0; Afterwards,<br>go see Vaska in the swamp.&#xA0; She'll have a quest, "Clay Pits", that needs done<br>and she gives the Kezath sephirah as a reward.&#xA0; After Vaska forks over her <br>sephirot, hit up the cave.&#xA0; Follow the zone wall to the west from the clay pits<br>to run right into it. In the back of the cave, kill the wraith and loot Vran's<br>Sarcophagus for the sephirot.<br>-Now there's but one left and that is held by Raymond. "Vizima Confidential"<br>will have to be advanced in order to obtain his. Once armed with all ten, head<br>to the swamp forest and start placing them.&#xA0; Follow the Quest Track from<br>"Monoliths" if having problems finding the right locations.<br>-After placing all the sephirot, the tower will be accessible.&#xA0; Once inside,<br>loot the trunk and read the tower mage book, then save. A nice little fight<br>will commence once back outside.&#xA0; Details for the fight are listed under<br>"Vizima Confidential".&#xA0; This quest is now over till chapter 3.</p><p>A PILGRIMAGE (If "The Cannibal" has been started, this quest isn't possible)<br>-This quest starts from Gramps in the swamp. He'll be near the docks and wants<br>an escort to the Melitele shrine. Follow the Quest Track, but be wary because<br>Coccacidium will most likely make an appearance during the trip.<br>-Now there are a few different places that may be worth visiting while gramps is<br>in tow which are:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The clay pits.&#xA0; He'll tell a few useful pieces of information about<br>them so long as he doesn't get dragged clear into the pit while fighting<br>drowners.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Northwest of the clay pits is an area called three islands. Get him<br>there while still on this quest and he'll give the recipe for the King and<br>Queen bomb as well as the recipe for Maribor Forest.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Dragging him clear up to the druid grove in the northwestern portion<br>of the swamp forest will result in details about places of power.<br>-After getting him to the melitele shrine, he'll give details on where to find<br>his hut and this quest finishes.</p><p>A RESTLESS GHOST<br>-Hildegard Zollstock begins this. She can be found wandering around in front<br>of the cemetary around noon.<br>-Seems that Hildegard's late husband has become a wraith and for more fun after<br>life, he wanders around in front of the cemetary gates at night spouting things<br>about the good widow. So after taking the job, find him at midnight in front<br>of the cemetary. He can actually be spoken to, so listen to some fun things he<br>has to say about his wife. Geralt will need to pull his blade to attack him<br>and use fast style. He's just like any normal wraith.<br>-After cutting down the husband, go back to the cemetary gates at noon to find<br>Hildegard. The cheap old bitty wants to cheat Geralt, but in the end, she fails<br>and the reward comes.</p><p>ANATOMY OF A CRIME<br>-Take a trip over to see Shani. Must talk to Shani at home about doing the<br>autopsy first, and then take a trip to the gravedigger.&#xA0; He'll let the body go,<br>but not for free. Seems he has a penchant for dwarven ale.&#xA0; So snag the<br>gravedigger his poison (Mahakaman Mead works just fine) and he'll agree to drop<br>the body off at the hospital around 11.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-While talking to the gravedigger, ask him how to get into the cemetary<br>and tell him Raymond seems untrustworthy.&#xA0; He'll say he either needs Vincent<br>Meis' permission, or clear his debt with Thaler.&#xA0; This will open "A<br>Gravedigger's Gratitude".<br>-On the following night walk over to the hospital after 11 at night. Shani<br>will be waiting in the back room with a rather messed up corpse. There is<br>now a few ways in which the autopsy can go:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;1. Comment on scavengers sucking the bone marrow out.&#xA0; Then go with<br>assassin's dagger.&#xA0; Next go with the liver, then go with Kalkstein. This will<br>finish the quest and point the finger at Kalkstein.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;2. Comment on scavengers sucking the bone marrow out. Then go with<br>assassin's dagger.&#xA0; Then go with the heart and finish it up with indications<br>pointing to Ramsmeat's men. This will finish the quest and implicate Ramsmeat.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;3.Comment on scavengers, followed by something is wrong with his head.<br>Then go to the liver. This will complete the quest and point the finger at <br>Kalkstein.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;4.Comment on scavengers, then move on to his neck muscles and palms<br>look tense. Afterwards, move on to can it be confirmed.&#xA0; The quest finishes<br>pointing the finger at Kalkstein.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;5.Comment on scavengers, followed by the neck muscles and palms looking<br>tense.&#xA0; Afterwards, choose that its too easy.&#xA0; This will finish the quest with<br>a most surprising outcome.<br>-Now, the fifth choice listed is the best outcome in terms of quest progression<br>if not doing "A Gravedigger's Gratitude".&#xA0; It updates all "Suspect:" quests as<br>well as "Vizima Confidential" and "What Lies Beneath".&#xA0; If doing "A<br>Gravedigger's Gratitude", implicating Kalkstein or Ramsmeat works better in the<br>swing of quests, but do not speak to Raymond until "A Gravedigger's Gratitude"<br>is done.&#xA0; It could lead to some complicated circumstances.&#xA0; Also, in order to<br>get outcome 5, it may be necessary to buy the book about Zerikannian insects.<br>-"Old Friend of Mine" updates regardless of the autopsy results.</p><p>BERENGAR'S SECRET<br>-Well, it looks like Berengar found a way into Vizima. So, time to have a look<br>around for him while attempting other endeavours.<br>-This will update when taking on the hunt for the cockatrice to win freedom from<br>jail.<br>-Talk to Thaler about the blade and Berengar's equipment.&#xA0; He'll point toward<br>Coleman, provided he's alive.&#xA0; Coleman won't talk about it. So talk to Ramsmeat<br>instead.&#xA0; He'll point toward the folks in the swamp, namely Vaska.<br>-Vaska will point toward the clay pits. So head on over there and look for a<br>Mutilated Corpse. There will be 2 bodies and one will have a salamandra broach<br>that's split in two. Take it to update.<br>-After "Force Recon", this will update that Berengar is alive and went willingly<br>with salamandra.</p><p>CLAY PITS<br>-This quest is started by Vaska in the swamp forest.<br>-She wants the clay pits cleared of drowners.&#xA0; Take the road toward the dock<br>but hang a right when it branches.&#xA0; There will be a whole mess of drowners<br>around the pits. Go in with group style silver to mop them up. They shouldn't<br>pose any real threat.<br>-Once they've been dealt with, go back to Vaska to learn she lied. She has no<br>money, but does give the Kezath sephirah, which is needed for "A Mysterious<br>Tower". This quest is then finished.</p><p>DICE POKER: THE NOVICE<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If running behind on this and still needing to beat a few people,<br>those who count as novices are Carmen at the Eager Thighs Brothel, Gardener at<br>Lebioda's hospital, and Vaska in the swamp forest.<br>-Find Munro Bruys at the Hairy Bear, Thaler at his house by the dungeon, or<br>Zoltan.&#xA0; Ask them about dice once 3 novices have been beaten. In one manner or<br>another, this quest will end and "Dice Poker: The Professional" will start.</p><p>DICE POKER: THE PROFESSIONAL<br>-This quest will open by speaking to Munro Bruys in the Hairy Bear, Thaler who<br>lives near the dungeon, or Zoltan once three novice players have been beaten.<br>-Naturally, both Munro and Thaler need to be trounced in order to progress this<br>quest during the chapter.<br>-There aren't anymore professionals to take on right now. So this quest will<br>pick up in the next chapter.</p><p>FINDERS KEEPERS<br>-This quest can also be done during the next chapter as well, so it will be<br>listed there too. It can either be done now or later. Really doesn't matter.<br>-Starts from Con Artist at the sewer entrance in Temple Quarter. He's only<br>there in the morning about 2 hours before sunrise.<br>-Enter the sewers and take the Bars right next to the Temple Quarter exit to<br>access the crypt.<br>-Take first 2 rights inside the crypt to get to the box with the ring. (Quest<br>Tracking will lead right to it)<br>-Return to the guy to find out, surprise surprise, the ring isn't a family<br>heirloom.&#xA0; Didn't see that coming from a con artist or anything.&#xA0; If its still<br>dangerous out, snatch the sword from its sheath, kill him and take the ring<br>back. It will sell for about 120 orens.</p><p>FISTFIGHT<br>-With Fat Fred trounced, time for someone stronger. So off to the Hairy Bear<br>Inn.<br>-Inside, find Butterbean awaiting a good thrashing. The wager is 75 orens.<br>He'll ask if Geralt has issues with fat people, say yes for some amusement.<br>-Humiliate Butterbean and collect the reward which can be:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-1. two bottles of mandrake cordial<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-2. gold necklace<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-3. 150 orens plus the original wager of 75</p><p>FLOWERS AND GOLD<br>-This quest can be acquired by speaking with Yaren Bolt at the lumberjacks'<br>glade in the swamp forest.<br>-He suggests collecting 5 beggartick flowers and taking them to the ferryman.<br>Beggartick can be found near the fallen tower. If foraging seems so tiring, talk<br>to a druid in the grove and he'll point out that the Elder Druid sells them.<br>Really though, one trip to the ruined tower will easily get the required 5.<br>-Run to the ferryman who will give 400 gold for them. Now its time to settle up<br>accounts with Yaren.<br>-The option to keep all 400 is available or give 200 to Yaren since he's the<br>one who mentioned it. Splitting it with him leads to everyone being happy. If<br>keeping it all, he gets a little agitated and won't speak for a while.<br>-Whichever is choosen, talk to him again to open up the next quest "A Long Way<br>from Home".</p><p>FORCE RECON (Dual-Faction Quest)<br>-This quest can be obtained from either Siegfried or Yaevinn at their<br>respective camps in the swamp forest after making the first turn in to<br>Vivaldi for "Worth Its Weight in Gold".&#xA0; If help is given to Siegfried, the<br>order armorer becomes usable. This has no lasting effect on alliance thoughout<br>the game nor will it effect future quests. And this quest can actually be<br>completely skipped.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If siding with Siegfried, be sure to turn in "Worth its Weight in<br>Gold" first. If Siegfried's request is accepted while on that quest, failure<br>will occur because Yaevinn won't be seen again this chapter. So after making<br>sure of quests, visit Siegfried at the clearing between the lumberjack camp<br>and the druid grove.&#xA0; He'll complain about a thorn or something and ask Geralt<br>to lead his knights.&#xA0; Accept and head to the golem burial ground.&#xA0; Its just a<br>short jaunt to the east. Kill a half dozen or so scoia'tael. Very the steel<br>sword styles depending on circumstance. After killing off the scoia'tael, head<br>back to Siegfried for the reward and quest finish. He'll also give some<br>information about Berengar.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If helping Yaevinn, make sure to turn in "The Drowner Contract" to<br>Siegfried first.&#xA0; Yaevinn can be found at the non-human camp near the ruined<br>tower.&#xA0; Offer to lead his soldiers to the golem burial ground to kill the order<br>scouts.&#xA0; Its to the southwest and Quest Track can lead.&#xA0; If going too fast, its<br>possible to actually leave the scoia'tael regimen behind. Kill off about a<br>half a dozen order soldiers once at the ruins.&#xA0; Vary steel sword styles based<br>on the situation.&#xA0; After massacring the ill-prepared troops, head back to<br>Yaevinn for the reward and quest finish.&#xA0; Being the nice guy that Yaevinn is,<br>he even looked into Berengar's dissappearance.<br>-Regardless of who is chosen, it turns out Berengar went with salamandra<br>willingly.&#xA0; Weird!&#xA0; "Berengar's Secret" will update.</p><p>HOT POTATO (Ongoing Quest)<br>-This starts from Haren in chapter 1 after finishing his first quest "Strangers<br>in the Night".<br>-Remember that package of Haren's?&#xA0; Look in quest items after the cockatrice has<br>been killed and items reclaimed from jail.&#xA0; Notice how the parcel has gone<br>missing.&#xA0; So, time to have a little chat with Jethro about it, and strangely<br>enough he seems to be sneezing a lot.<br>-Well, apparently whatever was in the parcel seems to have made its way into<br>Jethro's pockets...or nose.&#xA0; So time to give Coleman the news. He can be found<br>at the Hairy Bear, usually in the back room. Tell him the guards took it.&#xA0; All<br>is forgiven, quest finished.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now, if the scoia'tael were allowed to take the goods from Haren's<br>place back in chapter 1, this quest must be finished before talking to Raymond.<br>If its not, the scoia'tael that were allowed to walk off with the shipment in<br>chapter 1 will have a drive by with Coleman as the target.</p><p>MEMORY OF A BLADE<br>-This quest starts once in the sewer with the shiny new silver sword. First<br>objective is to find Thaler the fence after the cockatrice hunt. He has a<br>sparse little pad near the dungeon.<br>-After questioning him about the silver sword, "Suspect: Thaler" opens as well<br>as an update to "Berengar's Secret".&#xA0; Thaler said he got the sword from a<br>famous gambler at the Hairy Bear.&#xA0; So head over there during the day to find<br>Gambler. Ask him about the blade and he'll say he won it from the gardener at<br>Lebioda Hospital.<br>-Hunt down captain green-thumb outside the hospital and he'll tell a sob story<br>about how he was so certain he'd win the game and how he was friends with the<br>person who owned the silver sword.&#xA0; But he does point out Shani who knew the<br>blade's deceased owner. Talk to her at home since she won't spill anything at<br>the hospital.<br>-She'll go on about the Battle of Brenna. Then she'll say Zoltan is supposedly<br>a weapons expert. Time to track him down.&#xA0; Sometimes he's at Vivaldi's house,<br>sometimes he's at the Hairy Bear, and sometimes he's just wandering around town.<br>-After finding him, ask about the sword. This quest finishes with Geralt having<br>a true witcher's sword.</p><p>Monoliths<br>-This quest begins one of two ways:&#xA0; first it can start just by placing a<br>sephirah into one of the stones scattered throughout the swamp forest.&#xA0; The<br>second and quest-friendly way is by advancing "Vizima Confidential" to the<br>part of Raymond giving up the last sephirah.&#xA0; Either way, its a straight<br>forward quest.&#xA0; Just run around the swamp using Quest Track and the map to<br>place all 10 sephirot into their respective monoliths.&#xA0; After they've been<br>placed, this quest finishes and "A Mysterious Tower" updates.</p><p>OLD FRIEND OF MINE<br>-Starts by talking to Shani in the hospital.<br>-First objective, ask if she needs help.&#xA0; At which point she'll say no, then<br>she'll rattle off about celandine slowing the plague, so offer to get some.<br>They can be found in the swamp forest if there aren't any left over from<br>chapter 1. Either way, get them for her and then return to the hospital and<br>have a chat. Doesn't matter which option is choosen on turn in, it all ends<br>up the same way.<br>-She'll explain where she lives if asked, so go visit her in the evening, just<br>beware of the crazy old lady.&#xA0; She will approach and rattle some nonsense off<br>each time Geralt enters, and sometimes she'll throw him out for no good reason.<br>Also, do not try to enter while drunk.&#xA0; If she asks to have a drink, don't.<br>She won't let Geralt in at all if he's drunk.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-There is a way to get around this nutty old bag.&#xA0; First step is to<br>beat Thaler in drinking.&#xA0; In order to do that, go get 9 cups of weak alchohol<br>like Viziman Champion. If medium or better alcohol is used, Geralt is going to<br>wind up in the gutter with a hang over. Thaler will give a book after knocking<br>back 9 drinks. Go find Bootblack near Detective Raymond's home. If its the first<br>time visiting him, go through all of his dialogue and get a shoe shine. Talk to<br>him again and a gift option will show.&#xA0; Give him the book that Thaler forked<br>over. He'll give Geralt a ring. Put the ring on and go see the old bat. She'll<br>be very pleased to see Geralt when shown the ring and will let him pass.<br>-After finally getting upstairs to talk to Shani, she'll comment about the<br>crazy old broad downstairs. Really doesn't matter what choice is picked,<br>though she does have a little problem with saying the old bag should die. Shani<br>also doesn't have much to say until the question of the prisoner from "Vizima<br>Confidential" comes up.<br>-This quest will go on hold until after "Anatomy of a Crime". Once the autopsy<br>is done, talk to Shani at home.&#xA0; She wants to throw a party but first, she needs<br>booze. Precisely, she wants Rose Wine, cherry Liquor and Temerian Rye Vodka.<br>So head over to the waitress at the Harry Bear. Get some Cherry Spirit Cordial,<br>Temerian Rye, and Mettina Rose.<br>-Armed with the liquor, back to Shani. After giving her the refreshments,<br>she'll say to bring a friend. Naturally, having amnesia doesn't lend itself<br>to Geralt knowing too many people.&#xA0; So there are 3 choices:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Carmen - Yes, Carmen can be invited...for 100 orens. Shani however<br>doesn't exactly approve. If taking this path, Geralt will have to fetch<br>Grandma's Diary from downstairs...a place that is not good to go while drunk.<br>Anyway, once the diary is procured, head back to the party and talk to Carmen.<br>There will be an interesting exchange between Carmen and Shani once Dandelion<br>starts singing.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Zoltan - Zoltan will come for free so long as there is booze. If this<br>path is chosen, Geralt will need to fetch Grandma's Pickles and Lard, and then<br>talk to Zoltan again. Everyone gets along on this path.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Siegfried - Dandelion and Siegfried will get themselves into a nice<br>little squabble taking this route. Eventually a bottle of Grandma's Cordial will<br>be required. Siegfried will also sing...frightening.<br>-After the party, bring Shani some red roses. She'll tell a neat story about<br>Thaler that will solidify him as innocent if he isn't yet. Then she'll give her<br>sex card.&#xA0; Afterwards, this quest comes to a close.</p><p>* PRISON BREAK *<br>-Starts from Vincent Meis in the jail after playing the elf in dice poker.<br>-The first order of business is to pound some stupid out of the Muscleman in a<br>fistfight. Once that's done, have a chat with Vincent. He'll direct Geralt to<br>the genius Jethro who screw's up and immediately blurts out where they<br>confiscated a silver sword from, updating "Berengar's Secret".<br>-Once down in the sewers, there will be a new quest "Memory of a Blade" and<br>Geralt will be armed with a very handy silver sword. Nice little toy for<br>dissecting monsters.<br>-Now then, move forward just a bit and a knight named Siegfried will approach.<br>He'll chat a while and then comes decision time.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Let him tag along and he'll let Geralt into the Dike later on. Also,<br>the Order Armorer can be used.&#xA0; The downside is the guard will need to be paid<br>off to get into the hospital.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Deny his help by working alone, and go kill the cockatrice. Siegfried<br>will allow Geralt into the hospital for no charge. The downside is the order<br>armorer can't be used, and a guard will have to be paid off to get into the<br>Dike.<br>-After making the decision, the greater cockatrice can be found in the<br>south western portion of the sewer. Not really a difficult fight. The main<br>problem is it can hit pretty hard. Fast silver is the way to go on this guy.<br>Once its dead, loot its body to get its head as a trophy, a square item called<br>the Maal'kad Sephirah, a feather and possibly an ornithosaur's eye. The head<br>goes to Vincent, while the sephirah will be used in a later quest in the swamp.<br>The feather will also be used in a notice board quest in chapter 3, though its<br>not necessary to save it since plenty will be found later.<br>-Before leaving the sewers, have a look around. In the far southern end<br>there's a small alcove. In that dark alcove, there's the body of a knight.<br>He'll have a key and a note. Read the note, but don't go into the Lionhead<br>Spider cult just yet. The silver sword won't do a lot of damage to humans.<br>After retrieving the steel blade, come back. There are lots of goodies to<br>loot inside.<br>-Now with the cockatrice head dangling, follow Seigfried to the exit. Once<br>there, a bout with some salamandra assassins will commence. After they're<br>dead, Siegfried will tell of his friend who happens to be a detective. He'll<br>also give up a key to get out of the sewers.<br>-Head back to the dungeon and chat with Jethro for updates to "Witchers'<br>Secrets", a new quest "Suspect: Vincent Meis", and naturally a finish to this<br>quest.</p><p>SAFE HAVEN<br>-Started by talking to Zoltan Chivay who wanders about town and can sometimes<br>be found at Vivaldi's house or the Hairy Bear.<br>-Need to get access to the Dike.&#xA0; If Siegfried was allowed to tag along on the<br>kill for the cockatrice, he'll tell the guards to let Geralt through. Another<br>option if Siefgried isn't helping out is pay the guards off. Sometimes<br>Luevaarden can be found at the Antiquary during the day right around 6:30.<br>-Once Luevaarden is found, ask him about the problem and an update to hunt down<br>some drowners at the swamp forest dock will come.<br>-Talk to the ferryman at the Dike for passage to the swamp forest. There will<br>be a campfire next to a tree after getting off the boat. Either camp out till<br>evening or come back and wait near the fire.&#xA0; The drowners will pop up all<br>around the dock. Just kill them as they come until this quest updates.<br>-Once all the nasty little drowners are dead, head back to the Dike and tell<br>Declan of the successful nature of the mission to recieve the reward and end<br>this quest.</p><p>SUSPECT: RAMSMEAT<br>-Starts after questioning the prisoner in Lebioda Hospital.<br>-Time to have a chat with Ramsmeat about Salamandra. This can go several<br>different ways and it really doesn't matter how it goes.<br>-So after Ramsmeat rudely tells what he knows, case closed for now.<br>-There are two possible paths for this. Clear Ramsmeat during the autopsy in<br>"Anatomy of a Crime" or during "A Gravedigger's Gratitude". However, if he's<br>implicated during the autopsy and "A Gravedigger's Gratitude" isn't done, he'll<br>end up being killed.&#xA0; And even if he isn't implicated during the autopsy but<br>"A Gravedigger's Gratitude" isn't done, Raymond will pretty much order Geralt<br>to kill Ramsmeat. So look to "Anatomy of a Crime" and "A Gravedigger's<br>Gratitude" if wanting ways to avoid his death or if wanting to kill him.<br>-It is possible to clear Ramsmeat before the autopsy is ever done, though its<br>much simpler just to do it the other ways.</p><p>SUSPECT: KALKSTEIN<br>-Starts after questioning the prisoner in Lebioda Hospital.<br>-Need to have a chat with Kalkstein. Nothing is really learned from Kalkstein<br>accept that he hired the salamandra prisoner to protect him from salamandra and<br>to investigate some stuff in the swamp forest.<br>-Kalkstein can be cleared during the autopsy in "Anatomy of a Crime" or by<br>completing "A Gravedigger's Gratitude".<br>-Once he's cleared of any wrong doing, talk to him about the little problem<br>unconvered during the other two quests and he'll tell how to go about setting<br>everything to Geralt's advantage.</p><p>SUSPECT: LEUVAARDEN<br>-Starts when Raymond is attacked and gives Geralt a note about possible suspects<br>-Have a chat with Leuvaarden at the Dike. Naturally, no real proof of his<br>involvement can be discerned at the time. It is also possible to find him at<br>the antiquary around 6:30 in the evening on occasion.<br>-This quest can be updated during the course of "Wanted" after bringing 3 badges<br>to Declan. It will prove he's innocent. There is two other ways to prove he's<br>innocent as well, and that is through "Anatomy of a Crime" and "A Gravedigger's<br>Gratitude".<br>-No matter what way his innocence is learned, go tell him he's clear to finish<br>this quest and collect 500 orens.</p><p>SUSPECT: THALER<br>-Starts after having a chat with Thaler about Berengar's sword.&#xA0; Don't really<br>learn anything of value by talking to him though, so the case is closed for the<br>time being.<br>-There are three ways to clear Thaler of any involvement with salamandra. One<br>way is with the autopsy from "Anatomy of a Crime". The second way is by<br>following "Old Friend of Mine" and getting Shani's sex card, and the last way is<br>by getting the pass to enter the cemetary from Vincent and completing "A<br>Gravedigger's Gratitude".</p><p>SUSPECT: VINCENT MEIS<br>-This will start after the chat with Siegfried in the sewers.<br>-First have a dialogue with Vincent concerning Salamandra.&#xA0; He says to stay<br>away from the warehouse at midnight. So what's the first thing a child does<br>when told not to do something?&#xA0; That's right, make a trip to the warehouse near<br>the Hairy Bear Inn at midnight.<br>-Once going inside, Vincent is having a friendly conversation with some<br>salamandra goons. Either answer will work when pressed for a response, but<br>choosing the first answer of "Right" is a bit on the humorous side and gets<br>better results later. After slaughtering the goons, take a trip outside and<br>then wait around till morning to go have a serious talk with Vincent.<br>-Not a lot that can be done during the talk with him. Ask about Salamandra, but<br>he won't give anything up.<br>-If the scoia'tael were killed in chapter 1 at Haren's place, which allows<br>Coleman to live, and "The Rat" from Coleman is active, go to the house he told<br>you about and kill the cemetaur's in the basement. Coleman will show up on the<br>Dike talking to a guard, giving proof that Vincent is innocent. So after the<br>talk with Coleman on the Dike, go back and talk to Vincent. Ask him about<br>Salamandra and then tell him there's irrefutable proof he's not involved.<br>He'll give Geralt a city guard ring that will make the guards leave him alone.<br>Depending on how his innocence was proved, he may or may not give up the ring.<br>This quest finally finishes.<br>-If Coleman is dead, "Anatomy of a Crime" or "A Gravedigger's Gratitude" will<br>need to be done to prove Vincent vindicated.</p><p>SUSPECT: VIVALDI<br>-Quest begins after asking Jethro why the Professor was released from jail.<br>-Head on over to Vivaldi's place, which is near Kalkstein's lab.&#xA0; It'll seem<br>strange for someone that owns a bank to live so modestly.<br>-With nothing to go on when questioned, this quest goes on hold.&#xA0; Hunt down<br>Zoltan and ask him about Vivaldi.&#xA0; He has some interesting things to say.<br>-After Zoltan's revelation, head back to Vivaldi to give him the news that he's<br>definitely innocent.<br>-Vivaldi will give a little information on Azar Javed's background. It will also<br>end this quest.</p><p>THE ALGHOUL CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Once again, Kalkstein manages to amaze with his strange requests.&#xA0; He wants<br>the fresh marrow of 3 alghouls.&#xA0; Find them in the swamp forest lingering near<br>the fallen tower in the evenings. They should be with some normal ghouls and<br>feasting on corpses. They can also be found in the crypt of the cemetary if<br>the key has been procured from the gravedigger.<br>-After getting 3, head them back to Kalkstein in his lab.</p><p>THE CANNIBAL<br>-This quest starts by getting close to the table in a Solitary Hut found in the<br>north-eastern section of the swamp forest. If "A Pilgrimage" hasn't been done<br>and this quest is started, the opportunity for that quest is lost. Afterwards,<br>find the cannibal. And that happens to be an old man who favors the name Gramps.<br>He is also the same person that asks to be escorted to the altar of melitele in<br>"A Pilgrimage".&#xA0; So if he isn't in the hut already, go to the docks and look<br>around the path, he should be near.<br>-Once confronted about his bizarre eating habits, a choice comes up.&#xA0; Either<br>kill him, or let him live.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If allowed to live, he'll give up the recipe for Hanged Man's Venom.<br>He will also allow meditation at anytime by talking to him.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now if deciding to wax gramps, he's going to run out the door and<br>around the back of his shack. The old man somehow manages to cultivate himself<br>an entire garden of echinapse and even an archespor! Run near the first plant<br>and then quickly back off out of their firing range. Gramps will give chase,<br>so he can be pulled away from the carnivorous garden.&#xA0; He's a pretty standard<br>fight and fast steel style works well.&#xA0; The echinapse are another story. If<br>choosing to take them on, drink a swallow potion and a tawny owl.&#xA0; Run in and<br>take out a plant on the edge with strong silver. Feel free to back off if need<br>be, throwing an Igni beforehand and then run till out of range of them. When<br>health refills, run back in again, rinse and repeat. Shouldn't take long to<br>mow them all down, just be wary of the archespore.<br>-The only thing lost by killing gramps is the Hanged Man's Venom which can be<br>gotten later on, and a place to meditate.&#xA0; But there's fireplaces scattered all<br>around that can be lit at anytime with Igni rather than a flint, so its no big<br>loss. Either choice works fine since gramps plays no part in any other quest<br>aside from "A Pilgrimage" which can't be done if this quest is picked up first.</p><p>THE CROWN WITNESS<br>-This quest opens after talking to Raymond, the detective.<br>-First stop to make after this quest is having a chat with Vincent. Ask him<br>about the prisoner. Jethro is the next person to talk to.<br>-Ask Jethro about the prisoner and he'll say he isn't talking unless he's<br>brought a little powder. So time to get some fisstech.&#xA0; There are 3 ways to<br>obtain it. Kill a couple salamander goons that tend to walk the streets at<br>night or during the course of another quest. Buy fisstech from Coleman if he's<br>alive.&#xA0; Or it can actually be made using alchemy.&#xA0; The recipe is 1 Vermilion, 1<br>Quebirth, 3 Hydragenum and a high quality alcohol base.(Recipe acquired from<br>Seorin's Alchemy Combination Guide)<br>-With fisstech in hand, head back to Jethro and give it as a gift to the<br>junkie. He'll say the prisoner was taken to Lebioda Hospital.&#xA0; So, time for a<br>trip to the hospital.&#xA0; If Siegfried is out front, he'll let Geralt in without a<br>problem.&#xA0; If there's a normal guard out front, he'll have to be paid off.<br>-If going to the hospital during the day, have a chat with Shani first.&#xA0; Ask<br>her about the prisoner and she'll suggest coming back in the evening. If<br>trying to talk to him during the day, the guards will want a bribe, and then<br>they still won't let Geralt talk to him, saying come back at night. So, wait<br>till night.<br>-When night finally comes, give the guard 10 orens.&#xA0; At that point, the<br>prisoner will mutter a few things, then everything is interrupted by some of<br>Ramsmeat's men.&#xA0; This will give "Suspect: Kalkstein" and "Suspect: Ramsmeat".<br>-So, head on over and have a go with Raymond on the current situation.&#xA0; After<br>the conversation with him, this quest finishes and Raymond will point toward<br>Kalkstein and "Vizima Confidential" will update.</p><p>THE DOG CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-The gravedigger wants six pots of dog tallow.&#xA0; Not a difficult request. These<br>can be procured from any stray dog, but only at night.&#xA0; Have to draw a weapon<br>and then attack the dog and kill it.&#xA0; And Geralt can only draw his blade at<br>night or when being attacked while in the city.&#xA0; So spend an evening hunting<br>them down.&#xA0; Or just rummage through the houses in Temple Quarter. By the time<br>all of them are gone through, there should easily be 6 jars of dog tallow or<br>very near 6 jars.<br>-Take them to the gravedigger in front of the cemetary during the day.</p><p>THE DROWNED DEAD CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Siegfried wants some drowned dead terminated.&#xA0; Bring him the tongues of ten as<br>proof. They can be found all over the Swamp.&#xA0; They pretty much infest the<br>entire place.<br>-Find Siegfried once 10 are secured. He can be in 1 of three places depending<br>on how far the chapter has progressed. He can be in front of the hospital, in<br>front of the order of the flaming rose, or he can even be in the swamp forest<br>itself between the lumberjack clearing and the druid camp.</p><p>THE ECHINAPSE CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-The gardener wants 3 echinapse root stalks. These little beasties can be<br>found in the swamp forest.<br>-Must have the echinapse bestiary entry to complete this. The book can be<br>bought from the antiquary in town near Shani's house. The echinapse are<br>scattered throughout the swamp.&#xA0; There are two between the cave and the<br>lumberjack glade along the path through the forest. There's a few more on the<br>path around the fallen tower as well.&#xA0; Kill gramps during "The Cannibal" and<br>there will be an entire garden behind his house.<br>-Head them back to the old gardener that will be tending flowers behind the<br>hospital in the day.</p><p>THE RAT (If Coleman is killed by the scoia'tael, naturally this quest won't<br>be available)<br>-Quest starts from Coleman in the Hairy Bear. Seems he wants to have some<br>ghosts exorcised from a house. The place is near the sewer entrance, between<br>the detective's house and the entrance to the Dike.<br>-Be wary here. There are 2 wraiths inside. They like to inflict pain and can<br>be very dangerous at low levels. Aard can score a knockdown on them and can at<br>least back one off if being overwhelmed. Specter oil works well. Its a good<br>idea to use fast silver, focusing on one and bringing it down as fast as<br>possible. In the basement is four Gravier. In a crate on the floor is 3 very<br>old wine. These are used in another quest, "A Most Uncommon Wine", which is<br>obtained from Conrad at the Hairy Bear in the evening.<br>-Now go back to the Hairy Bear to give Coleman the news about the dead wraiths<br>and find that he's missing.&#xA0; Talk to the innkeeper to get the low down.<br>-With the knowledge that Coleman likes to frequent the Dike, head on over<br>whenever the chance presents itself. The first sight upon entering will be<br>Coleman having a nice chat with a city guard.<br>-After talking to Coleman, there's a choice to make. Talk to the innkeeper and<br>tell him Coleman was found.&#xA0; After which, the opportunity to give him up or<br>keep his secret is presented.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-To turn Coleman in for snitching, pick that he was seen informing.<br>This option nets Geralt 500 orens.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If wanting to keep Coleman around, say that he was found for the reward<br>but lost track of him. Upside to keeping him around is that he's the only person<br>that buys fisstech at about 20 oren a pop.</p><p>THE SENTRY<br>-This is started by Vaska after asking her about the mage tower in the swamp.<br>She'll give a card that needs to be taken to Kalkstein.<br>-After Kalkstein's explanation, he'll give the Golem's Pith scroll and say to<br>have a blacksmith make a lightning rod. The Order armorer will cost 70 orens and<br>can be used regardless of alliances. The dwarven armorer will cost 50 orens,<br>though he can't always be used depending on previous choices.<br>-After getting the lightning rod, its time for a thunderstorm. Go back to the<br>swamp forest and speak with the elder druid. Bring 500 orens. Apparently<br>thunderstorms aren't cheap. If not wanting to pay, just wait till it starts<br>raining and then place the rod.<br>-It'll come to life and attack.&#xA0; If still working with the base silver sword<br>acquired at the start of the chapter, but the steel sword does have a percent<br>to damage, use strong steel style.&#xA0; If both swords are comparable in damage,<br>go with strong silver. Once some damage has been dealt to the golem, touch 2 of<br>the pylon's. Move to the last pylon and when the golem nears it, touch it to<br>send a bolt of lightning down on it.&#xA0; If it doesn't die from the first bolt,<br>wail on him a bit more, then nail it again with another lightning bolt. The<br>golem must be between the 3 pylons and Geralt must be outside them. If he isn't<br>far enough outside the pylons, he'll get flattened by the lightning bolt too.<br>Depending on health, the bolt can one-shot Geralt or at the very least, drop<br>him to the point of near death.<br>-Once the golem goes down, loot it for the sephirah and take its heart for a<br>potion.&#xA0; This quest now comes to an end.</p><p>THE WOLF CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Jean-Pierre wants 10 wolf pelts.&#xA0; The wolves can be found in a cave between<br>the clay pits and the lumberjack clearing. They also tend to roam by the druid<br>grove.<br>-Once 10 pelts have been acquired, take them over to Jean-Pierre who will be<br>standing at the swamp forest docks during the day.</p><p>VIZIMA CONFIDENTIAL<br>-This quest opens after speaking with Raymond, the detective.<br>-The first step in this is to interrogate the witness.&#xA0; To find out where that<br>witness is, talk to Jethro.&#xA0; He likes his fisstech, so bring him some before<br>he'll cough up any details. Fisstech can be bought from Coleman if he's alive,<br>or it can be looted from the carcasses of assassins running around town at<br>night, or it can be made with alchemy using the recipe of: 1 Vermilion, 1<br>Quebirth, 3 Hydragenum and a high quality alcohol base.(Recipe acquired from<br>Seorin's Alchemy Combination Guide)<br>-After questioning the prisoner at the hospital, two new leads will open in the<br>form of "Suspect: Kalkstein" and "Suspect: Ramsmeat".&#xA0; Return to Raymond first.<br>-Raymond will suggest gaining Kalkstein's trust, so go have a chat with the<br>good alchemist and then have a talk with Ramsmeat to further their respective<br>suspect cases.&#xA0; Also, go have a chat with Shani.&#xA0; She has some interesting<br>things to say after the escapades at the hospital.<br>-Shani will say that the prisoner is being moved to a safe location.&#xA0; After<br>exhausting all of the current leads in the "Suspect:" quests, head back to<br>Raymond. He should be surrounded by salamandra thugs. He'll then run off after<br>saying to question Declan Leuvaarden who can be found at the Dike.<br>-After talking to Declan, this quest will switch to waiting for contact from<br>Raymond.&#xA0; The next time entering the Temple Quarter's main streets, a child<br>will say that Raymond is waiting at home.<br>-Raymond wants more money for his expenses. After giving up the 200 orens for<br>his doubled fees, he'll say the prisoner died and asks to have Shani do an<br>autopsy, which opens the quest "Anatomy of a Crime".&#xA0; The investigation goes on<br>hold till after the autopsy.<br>-Now, depending on how the autopsy went, Raymond will need to be left alone for<br>a bit.&#xA0; When returning, he'll say he has irrefutable proof that Ramsmeat is<br>guilty. He won't say what that proof is, but he wants Ramsmeat dead. Depending<br>on how the autopsy went and whether or not "A Gravedigger's Gratitude" was done,<br>either kill Ramsmeat or tell Raymond that he's dead.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now if Ramsmeat needs to die, know this...he isn't alone.&#xA0; His room<br>will fill up with somewhere around a dozen men. Group style is preferred with<br>this endeavour. When everyone is dead, loot the body and head back to Raymond.<br>At this point, Geralt is going to be a little upset that there wasn't any<br>evidence and the quest will progress with Raymond placating Geralt for now and<br>giving over the last sephirah.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If just telling Raymond that Ramsmeat is dead, then leave the house<br>and go back in.&#xA0; The quest will progress naturally and he'll give up the last<br>sephirah and "Monoliths" will open.&#xA0; Though if some of the sephirot have already<br>been placed, "Monoliths" will have already began.<br>-Once all 10 sephirah are in place, head to the tower. Raymond will be waiting<br>outside.</p><p>WANTED (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Talk to Jethro and he'll tell about a man that rewards for Salamandra badges.<br>He spends his evenings at the Hairy Bear and goes by the discreet name of<br>Messenger.<br>-On the first visit to this guy, tell him either 100 orens to talk or the other<br>option of mangling him.&#xA0; Now when talking to him the next time, any salamandra<br>badges in inventory can be sold to him for 10 gold apiece. Or if looking to<br>quickly progress, ask him to drink.&#xA0; Toussaint Red works well and takes about 3.<br>After he's hammered, ask him about getting work.&#xA0; He'll say Declan has all<br>kinds of jobs.<br>-Go talk to Declan who will request proof in the form of 3 salamandra badges.<br>-Once the badges are turned in, "Suspect: Leuvaarden" will update if the quest<br>is still ongoing. There will also be a promise of help on crushing salamandra<br>from Declan.</p><p>WHAT LIES BENEATH<br>-Quest starts after talking to Raymond, the detective.<br>-need to look for leads. Not a lot to this one. Just follow the suspect quests<br>and this will update along the way.<br>-After exhausting the suspect quests, update this in two ways. Through<br>"Anatomy of a Crime" or "A Gravedigger's Gratitude". Both are listed on how to<br>get them.<br>-Now if "A Gravedigger's Gratitude" is done or the fifth choice listed for<br>"Anatomy of a Crime" is gotten, talk to Kalkstein and go through all of his<br>dialogue about salamandra and Azar. This quest will finish up once Kalkstein<br>has given a strategy.</p><p>WITCHERS' SECRETS (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Nothing that can be directly done with this so just continue normal quests<br>and pay it little mind.</p><p>WORKING GIRLS<br>-Starts from Carmen who will either be outside or inside of the Eager Thighs<br>Brothel.&#xA0; Its located near the Hairy Bear Inn.<br>-She wants some thugs that are hassling her girls taken care of. The locations<br>will show with Quest Track, but the first place to visit is right in front of<br>the hospital.&#xA0; The second place is in front of Vivaldi and Kalkstein's place.<br>And the last girl to rescue is in front of Shani's house.&#xA0; After helping them<br>all out, head back to Carmen.&#xA0; As usual, she will be standing outside of the<br>Eager Thighs Brothel or if its night, she'll most likely be inside.<br>-There is a choice of 2 rewards: 200 orens, or favors.&#xA0; The favors is by giving<br>flowers to any of the girls in return for some...stress relief.&#xA0; However, even<br>if taking the money, they'll still give a discount and it'll cost about 100<br>orens for some quality time.</p><p>WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD<br>-This quest comes from Yaevinn.&#xA0; He can be found in the swamp forest hanging<br>around the druid grove. He wants a letter delivered to Vivaldi.<br>-Vivaldi will say to come back later for his answer regardless of the option<br>chosen. So just head outside and come back in to get it. Then go back to the<br>swamp forest to tell Yaevinn the not-so-good news.<br>-Head to the druid grove and talk to any normal druid. He'll say that Yaevinn<br>isn't around and he doesn't know where he went. Now head to the non-human camp.<br>It can be found between the ruined tower and gramps' hut.&#xA0; The scoia'tael in<br>the camp should be seen from a distance. Quest Track will also lead to it.<br>-Just tell Yaevinn that Vivaldi is bankrupt when he asks during turn in. Quest<br>finished.</p><p>=======================================================<br>Chapter 3++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>=======================================================<br>Chaper 3 opens in Triss' house in the Trade Quarter.&#xA0; By the stairs will be a<br>mirror.&#xA0; This mirror can teleport to the mage tower in the swamp forest or<br>Kalkstein's lab in the Temple Quarter.&#xA0; Very handy.&#xA0; Later, it can be used to<br>teleport to the sewers as well.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;+Monster Hunts+</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;WHITE FANG<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-This monster is a wolf named Voref.&#xA0; He wanders near the golem ruins<br>in the swamp with 3 other wolves in tow.&#xA0; If armed with some Samum bombs, he<br>should be able to be stunned and killed fairly quickly. Just rush in with group<br>style steel and attack him till all his little friends are dead, then go buck<br>nutty in strong style.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-When the head is secured, go to Royal Huntsman in Trade Quarter for the<br>600 oren reward.&#xA0; He's seated near the watch tower right by the cemetary<br>entrance.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;THE PREDATORY WYVERN<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-This monster is a wyvern named Moa and lingers in the wyvern islands<br>in the north of the swamp.&#xA0; He is surrounded by several other Royal Wyverns.<br>Best option is to slowly pull the wyverns back till a clear path to him is open.<br>Taking them all on is pretty much suicide, especially considering normal wyverns<br>will drop out of nowhere and join the fray.&#xA0; Strong silver should work well and<br>he can be stunned.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Once the head is taken, go back to the Royal Huntsman near the guard<br>tower in Trade Quarter for 600 orens.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Quick note: Take the wyvern eggs recieved from the royal wyverns and<br>put them in storage. They'll be used for a notice board quest in the next<br>chapter.</p><p>A GAME OF DICE (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Currently this should be up to "The First Few Games"<br>-Professionals to play for progression are:<br>-The Heirophant at the druid grove in the swamp forest and Velerad at the watch<br>tower in the Trade Quarter.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-De Wett will play poker if Thaler is killed outside of the New Narakort<br>after "A Posh Reception".<br>-Only 2 need to be beaten if Thaler and Munro were taken on last chapter.&#xA0; Also,<br>there are more professionals next chapter if missing a few so it isn't necessary<br>to kill Thaler if lagging behind.<br>-Hunt down Zoltan Chivay in the Temple District.&#xA0; He'll say to find some<br>real sharpers to play. If Zoltan can't be located, this quest can be progressed<br>during the next chapter, or by Koster in the back alley gambling house within<br>the Trade Quarter. </p><p>A LOST LAMB (Continued from Chapter 2)<br>-This quest can be updated during "Reaping Time".<br>-The spiritually-touched little boy can finally be found in the cave in the<br>swamp forest while freeing the brickmakers of Salamandra's reign of terror.<br>He won't show up there until the quest "Reaping Time".<br>-Head back to Vaska for the reward.</p><p>A MYSTERIOUS TOWER (Continued from Chapter 2)<br>-Now that the tower is open, there is a little clearing up to do.&#xA0; Kalkstein<br>offered a thousand gold to anyone that could get him in.&#xA0; So, head back to the<br>tower.&#xA0; Kalkstein is inside and he's as giddy as a school girl with her first<br>cell phone. Collect the 1000 oren reward and quest finished.</p><p>A POSH RECEPTION<br>-IMPORTANT NOTE:&#xA0; If on the "Echoes of Yesterday" quest, finish it before doing<br>this quest or echoes will be a failure.<br>-Just show up at the New Narakort after 6.&#xA0; The stairs will be open. There's a<br>lot of talking to do.<br>-When ready, head up the stairs and talk to Triss.<br>-Go into the next room and talk to Declan, then talk to Velerad, Thaler, and<br>Erkyn.&#xA0; Get ready to throw a few back with Erkyn.&#xA0; Get him good and drunk<br>(Toussaint Red works well and takes 5).&#xA0; He'll break his vow of silence and<br>give a ring for House of the Night. Gets a discount on the girls and gets<br>access upstairs without having to throw down with the bouncer.&#xA0; Now suck down<br>some wive's tears, or stagger on over to chat with Adda. Doesn't matter what<br>choice is used for the first time speaking to her, but asking about the curse<br>makes a little more sense when talking to Velerad the second time.<br>-Now chat with Velerad again. Then have a go with Thaler ("Identity" will<br>update during the talk with him). After them, head back over to potty mouth<br>Adda. Eventually it'll get around to asking about the king and Adda refuses<br>to answer unless she gets something she desires.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Refuse Adda and she'll leave.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Agree to find what she desires, and get her sex card. So time to have<br>a talk with Velerad. He won't spill the beans until given some vodka. Have a<br>chat with Thaler and he refuses to tell until Geralt goes to the next room and<br>gets something out of a box.&#xA0; Its the door right next to the stairs. As soon as<br>the contents of the box are taken, a wealthy merchant interrupts. Say a<br>superior drink was the target.&#xA0; He'll naturally want some. There doesn't appear<br>to be anything he actually likes, so whatever is handy. Head back to Thaler<br>with the letter from the box, but not before reading it. He'll finally cough up<br>what Adda likes and now its time to ask Velerad how its prepared. Once done with<br>him, time to chat with Triss...who isn't very happy about it. After getting the<br>dish, back to Adda. She wants to meet in the alcove. Same room those papers were<br>just stolen from.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Doesn't matter what the choice taken once in the alcove, it'll come<br>down to her jumping on Geralt. There will also be a hint at her intentions.<br>-Now regardless of whether the sex card was gotten or not, Triss says to have a<br>chat with Declan and this completes "A Posh Reception" and opens "Lock and Key".<br>The alchemy recipe for White Raffard's Decoction is also had in the deal.</p><p>ALL THE KING'S MEN<br>-Starts at the beginning of the chapter.<br>-This will update immediately after leaving Triss' house when approached by a<br>guard.<br>-After "A Posh Reception" head outside New Narakort to see a disturbance between<br>De Wett and Thaler. There will be a choice of whether to kill Thaler or tell<br>De Wett to go copulate with himself.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Waxing Thaler isn't the ideal path to take. For some strange reason,<br>after laying Thaler flat, De Wett wants to forget what's been done. He'll speak<br>to Geralt in the watch tower and even play poker though. There is no real<br>detriments from killing Thaler, aside from killing a completely innocent man.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If letting Thaler live, have a walk over to New Narakort to talk to<br>him and find out the royal edicts are royal fakes.<br>-Next update will come during "Lock and Key".<br>-After "Lock and Key", ask Triss at home to learn Radovid's location.<br>-Take a jaunt over to Radovid's pad and listen to his long-winded spiel on<br>political gain.&#xA0; And he'll confirm that Thaler was telling the truth about the<br>royal edicts being forgeries.</p><p>* BEAUTY AND THE BEAST *<br>-Starts with Carmen who is hanging around the landing in the swamp forest. She<br>says her man is a werewolf and she wants to help him. Offer to go to the<br>druids for her.<br>-Talk to the Heirophant in the druid grove to learn of a rather foolish remedy<br>and a very corny one.<br>-Head back to Temple Quarter and find Carmen either in front of or inside Eager<br>Thighs Brothel and tell her there is a rememdy...but she has to give up her man<br>for it. She'll naturally refuse with Geralt being the monster slaying tyrant<br>he is, and the quest goes on hold. Talk to her later to get her real name which<br>she thinks is way too common for a hooker. And if paying attention and she was<br>invited to Shani's party back in chapter 2, that whole "To Hela" comment she<br>made actually makes sense.<br>-Quest will naturally progress later in the chapter during "Lock and Key" and a<br>rather important choice will come up.&#xA0; Kill the werewolf, or let him go.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If the decision is to kill the wolf, use strong silver. He really<br>isn't much of a threat. Also, killing him is a BAD idea.&#xA0; Not only is the<br>abilty made from his fur pretty useless, his help later on in 2 places is lost,<br>the quest is failed, and even Carmen vanishes, though she will reappear in the<br>epilogue with some startling news about her life.<br>-Now, if letting him go so he can do his superhero thing, head back to Carmen<br>and give her 5 Fool's Parsely. Because nothing is simple, that remedy doesn't<br>work.&#xA0; So now to find another remedy.<br>-Remember talking with the Heirophant the first time? Yup, a potion is the next<br>step. So off to Kaulkstein who is violating himself in the swamp Mage Tower.<br>Lucky thing is, he's still overjoyed at being in the tower, so free<br>werewolf-curing juice.<br>-Now the potion isn't done yet until a virgin's tear is added. And in a world<br>where even a princess will sleep around if given some steak, where does a<br>Witcher find a virgin's tear? Strangely, one of the brickmaker women claims to<br>be a virgin. So have a chat with them inside their homes. Or better yet, a nun.<br>So onward to the hospital in the Temple Quarter to have a chat with one of the<br>nun nurses about her virtue.<br>-After giving the completed potion over to Carmen, and finding out that super<br>wolf still enjoys his roof-hopping lifestyle, tell her the last known cure of<br>true love. Then give her a lecture on how being a werewolf isn't the biggest<br>problem. She'll ask you to go set her man straight.<br>-After giving the werewolf in human form the once over, head to Carmen to hear<br>it finally worked. Quest finished and help is secured for later.</p><p>BERENGAR'S SECRET<br>-Should be at the step of Berengar is Alive!<br>-Nothing to do directly this Chapter.</p><p>BLUE EYES<br>-Starts with Patrick de Weyze at New Narakort<br>-Talk to Carmen in Temple Quarter (this step can be skipped and go straight to<br>the brothel in Trade Quarter)<br>-Head to House of the Queen of the Night and talk to the Blue-eyed Lass. Choose<br>to spend the night with her for 500 orens...if wearing the ring from "A Posh<br>Reception" it'll only cost 300. She'll also take a saphire instead of money.<br>This gets her sex card. Ask about the scar on her neck and tell her that her<br>brother is looking for her.<br>-Head back to New Narakort and talk to Patrick.&#xA0; He'll say someone must be<br>controlling her mind and its back to the House of Ill Repute.&#xA0; Talk to the<br>bouncer and show him the ring if wearing it, if not, beat him down with a<br>fistfight.<br>-Talk to the Lady of the Night upstairs. She'll inform that the blue-eyed lass<br>isn't under any spell and a choice comes up.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Choose to kill the vampires which will really upset the blue-eyed lass.<br>She takes off and when talking to her brother, no reward.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Tell the Lady of the Night "You Win" and get the vampire sex card.<br>Patrick will bust in afterwards. Tell him there was no mind control. Then<br>slaughter him and his lackeys. The blue-eyed lass will be overjoyed. Just be<br>sure the Lady of the Night doesn't die during the fight. Tends to ruin the whole<br>moment. Still no monetary reward, but possibly a warm fuzzy in the gut.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Kill them all by sleeping with the vampires and then telling them it<br>has nothing to do with Geralt. That will pit everyone against Geralt. After<br>the carnage, the blue-eyed lass is extremely disgusted and takes off.</p><p>DANDELION'S LUTE<br>-This quest starts with Dandelion in New Narakort.<br>-Ask him about his lute, but he won't tell until he's good and drunk. Toussaint<br>Red works well and there should be plenty of it. Also, run through his other<br>dialogue choices to hear of a character named Toruviel that will be met later<br>on in Chapter 4.<br>-After getting him toasted, head over to the merchants house. Just tell him<br>whatever, it all leads to a fistfight. The brawl with him is fairly simple and<br>no different from a normal Fistfight except he begs like a little girl after<br>being trounced. Now upstairs to woo his pretty little daughter out of a lute.<br>-A few steps away from the stairs and the naughty daughter will start some<br>dialogue. Tell her by giving up the lute it shows she dumped Dandelion. She'll<br>go off on a tangent about how he proposed and she turned him down. Tell her to<br>stop at the marriage proposal, then get another choice. Either cheer her up, or<br>simply get the lute. Choose to cheer her up, then answer her question that a<br>Witcher's touch tingles. This will net her sex card. The lute is in a trunk in<br>her room.<br>-Return to Dandelion for the reward.</p><p>DICE POKER: THE PROFESSIONAL (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Those available to play this chapter are Heirophant in swamp forest, Velerad in<br>the watchtower, Munro in the Hairy Bear if he hasn't been beaten yet, De Wett in<br>the watchtower if Thaler is killed.<br>-Play and beat the Heirophant at the druid grove in the swamp.<br>-Play and beat Velerad at the guard tower in the Trade Quarter.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If Thaler was killed outside the New Narakort, De Wett can be played<br>for an update instead of 1 of the others.<br>-Munro can be found at the Hairy Bear, though chances are he's already been<br>beaten.</p><p>DICE POKER: THE SHARPER<br>-This quest can be started by Koster in a back alley gambling house in the<br>Trade District.&#xA0; To find it, run east along the back wall at the Maribor Gate.<br>A merchant will be standing to the right and directly in front of him on the<br>left is the door. Can't play Koster until "Dice Poker: The Professional" is<br>finished.<br>-Once 3 professionals are beaten, it is possible to play Koster. He'll show up<br>during the evening.</p><p>DIPLOMACY AND HUNTING<br>-Quest starts from Vaska after finishing "Reaping Time". If Geralt has already<br>killed Roland Bleinheim at the non-human camp, this quest will be finished.<br>-Visit the Heirophant at the druid grove once this quest is started.<br>-Go to the cave and get the Psilocybe mushroom. Its all the way in the back of<br>the cave and looks just like any other harvestable cave plant.<br>-After turning the mushroom over to the Heirophant, follow him to the meeting<br>area, which happens to be the lumberjack's camp. He brings along a few wyverns<br>to lend a hand. He also walks really slow.<br>-Once the Heirophant gets to the meeting area, the fight will start with several<br>salamanders, Roland, and 2 kikimore warriors. After Roland is dead, search his<br>body then talk to the Heirophant again to finish the quest.<br>-Finishing this quest also updates "Witchers' Secrets".</p><p>ECHOES OF YESTERDAY<br>-Starts from Yaevinn in the druid grove in the swamp forest. This quest becomes<br>unavailable once "A Posh Reception" is done.<br>-Enter the sewers from the Trade Quarter.&#xA0; (Quest Track will show the way)<br>-Talk to Ren Grouver, then cross the wood and into the hole in the wall. The<br>target is a Bruxa.&#xA0; There's also a nifty teleport here as well. Once the<br>bruxa is dead, Yaevinn gives the 300 oren reward and Geralt is free to loot the<br>next room and use the teleporter.</p><p>FINDERS KEEPERS<br>-If this was done last chapter, it won't be available this chapter.<br>-Starts from a Con Artist at the sewer entrance in Temple Quarter. He's only<br>there in the morning about 2 hours before sunrise.<br>-Enter the sewers and take the bars directly to the left to access the crypt.<br>-Take the first 2 rights inside the crypt to get to the box with the ring.<br>(Quest Track will lead right to it)<br>-Return to the guy to find out, surprise surprise, they aren't family heirlooms.<br>Its stolen goods.&#xA0; Didn't see that coming from a con artist or anything. Now if<br>its still considered dangerous out, draw the steel sword and kill him. Search<br>his body and take back the ring which can then be sold.</p><p>FISTFIGHT (ongoing quest)<br>-Should now have Fat Fred and Butter Bean both beaten. The next chellenger<br>awaits at the Hairy Bear Inn and it'll cost 200 orens to have a go with him.<br>-Andrew Baglodda isn't difficult. Just block and swing like the last two. There<br>is a chance of another fistfighter standing in the middle of the floor. If so,<br>this fight could become troublesome. He'll get in the way of targeting and can<br>stop Geralt's blows mid-swing making them not connect. If this happens, move<br>Geralt away from the guy, though be careful not to move out of the cirlce of<br>fighters or its a loss. After he's coughing up blood, a choice is given for:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Meteorite steel and a runic stone &gt; red meteorite with damage +15%<br>and a svarog rune which temporarily increases hit and damage by 40% and critical<br>hit by 5%.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Magical sign and runic stone &gt; earth rune with damage +10% and<br>knockdown chance of 25% and a svarog rune which temporarily increases hit and<br>damage by 40% and critical hit by 5%.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Gold &gt; 200 oren bet back plus 300 more<br>-This quest is done until chapter 4.</p><p>FOLLOWING THE THREAD<br>-Starts from the town junkie Jethro in the dungreon of Temple Quarter<br>-Talk to Angus. He's standing on the corner before the door for the Hairy Bear<br>Inn<br>-Follow Angus back to his house then unleash a sound beating upon him.<br>-Read the note he drops then head to the sewers - though its a good idea to<br>empty inventory into storage before heading there because the place is filled<br>with explosive powder, food items, potion bases and numerous other things.<br>(could also look at the quest journal at this point.&#xA0; It mentions a word with<br>the letters "th--n".&#xA0; This is a password. The innkeaper of the New Narakort<br>will also speak of it if paid.&#xA0; The word is actually "Thorn")<br>-There could be some rubish in the path to get to the salamandra drug ring if it<br>wasn't cleared earlier. Just blast it away with the Aard Sign then talk to the<br>guys at the door. Tell them Angus said it was a good place to score some<br>fisstech, then give the password Thorn. This allows Geralt to walk in and loot<br>the whole place first without any fights. Be sure to stop and talk to the head<br>chemist asleep on a blanket. Tell him it'll be a secret that he was sleeping and<br>he'll cough up Petri's Filter recipe.<br>-After the place has been looted, follow the Quest Track to the box. Then fight<br>back out to the beginning where Jethro will be waiting. Quest finishes and<br>picks up with "The Viziman Connection".</p><p>* GOLD RUSH *<br>-This quest will become available after "A Posh Reception". A boy will approach<br>Geralt and ask to be followed. He could pop up in a number of places during<br>either the day or night and both the Temple and Trade Quarters. Turns out the<br>bank is being robbed.<br>-This quests dictates whether Geralt sides with the Order of the Flaming Rose or<br>the Scoia'tael. The decision here affects events in chapter 4 that decide<br>alliances in chapter 5 and ultimately 1 of the 3 endings.<br>-Whether chosing to go in the front or use another entrance, it all ends up with<br>the same decision. However, if needing fleder fangs, ask if there is another<br>entrance and then go in through the warehouse where fleders can be found. If<br>Seigfreid isn't at the bank yet, the decision will change slightly and Velerad<br>will need to be told that Witcher's work alone to go in the warehouse entrance.<br>-Once downstairs with Yaevinn, he'll ramble off a story and then the decision<br>comes up. Tell Yaevinn witchers are neutral and Geralt sides with the Order. Or<br>chose to help him and Geralt sides with the Scoia'tel. Or as expected, side with<br>the Order and kill all the non-humans in the place.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If siding with Yaevinn, get ready because there's 2 Kikimore warriors<br>and 4 kikimore workers waiting in the sewer. One amusing drawback to siding<br>with the non-humans is the hookers in Temple Quarter will want nothing to do<br>with Geralt.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If siding with the Order, chase the scoia'tael into the sewer and kill<br>about a half a dozen of them.<br>-Regardless of the decision, leave through the normal sewer exit, teleportation<br>is down. If siding with Yaevinn, quest is finished. If siding with Siegfried,<br>go talk to Velerad who is still hanging around outside the bank to finish up.</p><p>IDENTITIY<br>-This quest is actually progressed by quest choices made in the rest of the<br>game.<br>-First update should come during "A Posh Reception" by speaking to Thaler.<br>-Next update will come during "Gold Rush". After "Gold Rush", talk to Triss<br>about identity to see the decision.<br>-Following update will come after deciding whether to kill the werewolf or not.</p><p>LOCK AND KEY<br>-Started after finishing "A Posh Reception"<br>-This quest is part of 2 others. The first is "Following the Thread" and<br>second is "Diplomacy and Hunting". "Following the Thread" is given by Jethro<br>in Temple Quarter while "Diplomacy and Hunting" is given by Vaska after doing<br>her other quest "Reaping Time".<br>-When finished with the other quests, head back to Declan to give him the<br>documents.<br>-After turning the papers over, he'll say to come back later. Just take a<br>jaunt outside into the Trade Quarter and back.&#xA0; He'll feel talkative then.<br>-Now to destroy the last Salamandra cell in the Merchant District after finding<br>the proper guard. However, before the guard will show up, Geralt must make a<br>moron out of himself and talk to the 2 wandering guard officers. After finding<br>the wandering officers, the proper officer shows up outside the House of the<br>Queen of the Night (Ill Repute). Talk to him and he'll give details on the<br>sewer excursion.<br>-Now that the guard has stopped thinking he's funny, head down to the sewers<br>around midnight. There's a fireplace right at the meeting area, so if the urge<br>hits, impatience, ADHD, whatever, just go into the sewers early and camp till<br>midnight.<br>-After taking the latter and entering the house, head toward the back to start<br>a cut scene and when it finishes, kill all the salamandra officers. Once they're<br>dead go over to the mirror and give it a click to get some dialogue from the<br>person that salamandra was asking help from.<br>-After chatting with the mirror, which updates "All the King's Men", snag the<br>stone and head downstairs. There's about 7 salamandra goons, but nothing<br>serious. Group style steel makes short work of them.&#xA0; After looting the place<br>and heading back outside, time to have a meet and greet with a werewolf for<br>"Beauty and the Beast".<br>-Now head to Triss. Once done speaking to her, "All the King's Men" updates.<br>-Talk to Triss again, finishing this quest and "The Unforgiven" starts.</p><p>MEDIC IN DISTRESS<br>-This quest starts from Distressed Nurse standing beside the hospital in Temple<br>Quarter. She only shows up around noon.<br>-follow the Quest Track to the house. If going during the day, granny won't<br>let Geralt have the run of the house. Go meditate till midnight or do some other<br>quests and come back.<br>-Kill the Fleder in the basement and then have a talk with granny. Crazy old<br>bat is a little mad that her son was killed.<br>-Head back to the Distressed Nurse at noon and listen to her tell of how kind<br>Shanni thinks Geralt is and collect the 50 oren reward.</p><p>REAPING TIME<br>-Starts from Vaska in the Swamp Forest.<br>-Follow the Quest Track. First place is near the sunken tower north of the<br>mage tower. Couple salamandra thugs with a few villagers. After the salamander<br>forces are killed, the villagers will start a dialogue.<br>-Follow the Quest Track to the second area which happens to be in the Caves. Now<br>in the cave, after killing the salamandra thugs and the forced dialogue with the<br>brickmakers, a little boy is going to be left there. He's the missing kid for<br>"A Lost Lamb" that started in chapter 2. Also, lots of cockatrice's in the<br>cave, so trek further in and nab those feathers for "The Cockatrice Contract"<br>if that quest is still ongoing. There is also a quest item in the back called<br>Psilocybe. It is used for "Diplomacy and Hunting" and will be needed if the<br>Heirophant is going to be called in for help. If the nonhuman camp has already<br>been cleared, don't bother with it.<br>-Follow the Quest Track to the last area which is the Lumberjacks' Camp. Couple<br>more salamandra stooges to finish.<br>-Head back to Vaska for a reward. She gives the waterlord's blessing, oh my,<br>and a nifty book called Hymns of Madness and Despair, which actually happens to<br>be illegal in Vizima. Truly some spectacular reading material. This also opens<br>up the quest, "Diplomacy and Hunting" after talking to Vaska if the nonhuman<br>camp hasn't been obliterated yet.</p><p>SIX FEET UNDER<br>-Quest starts with Seigfried outside of the Order headquarters near the<br>cemetary. He wants the cemetary checked out.<br>-Head into the cemetary and in the center of the crumbling structure, there's a<br>rather gluttonous ghoul that can talk. Once approached and conversation starts,<br>a choice will come up to either let him go, or kill him.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If letting him be, he'll say the real killers are the pointy-eared ones<br>and then run off. Head over to the elves and dwarves standing next to the crypt<br>entrance. There is another choice to make of chasing them when they run off, or<br>rescue the people they left to the ghouls in the crypt. The trapped people are<br>straight back in the last room on the right surrounded by ghouls and alghouls.<br>Saving the people trapped inside will make the do-gooder Seigfriend nearly go<br>teary-eyed over Geralt's valiant heroics and knightly choice. This also gets<br>access to use the Order Armorer and a pay of 400 orens.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If letting Vetala be, but chasing the elves, the people can't be<br>saved. Returning to Siegfried also doesn't yeild a lot and he's rather upset<br>that innocent people died when they could have been saved, so 100 orens is the<br>reward.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If choosing to slay Vetala, there will also be a mix of ghouls,<br>alghouls, and cemetaurs. About a half a dozen in total. Return to Seigreid<br>for a 200 oren reward.<br>-If going for money, let Vetala be and save the people in the crypt.</p><p>THE ARCHESPORE CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Find 3 vials of Archespore juice.<br>-There are very few of these. 2 of them can be found near the mage tower<br>during the evening and night. There are also 2 almost directly in the middle<br>between the clay pits, altar of milintele, and the cave. Be careful not to use<br>it by accident in alchemy.<br>-Take the juice to Jethro for a reward.</p><p>THE COCKATRICE CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Only place to find cockatrices is the cave in the swamp forest.<br>-Take them to the scribe at town hall in Trade Quarter</p><p>THE FLEDER CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Fleders can be found in a few places. The cemetary will cough a couple up.<br>Also, taking the warehouse entrance during "Gold Rush" will net the required<br>amount.<br>-Take them to Velerad at the guard tower in Trade Quarter. Have to turn them<br>in after "A Posh Reception".</p><p>THE GHOUL CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Ghouls are another group of monsters that are easy to find.&#xA0; They run rampant<br>in the cemetary, as well as in the evening near the fallen tower in the swamp<br>forest.<br>-Take them to Velerad at the guard tower in Trade Quarter. Have to turn them<br>in after "A Posh Reception".</p><p>THE GRAVIER CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Graviers can be slightly more difficult to locate. Get them in the swamp near<br>the fallen tower in the evenings. A few can also pop up in the cemetary.<br>-Take them to Velerad at the guard tower in Trade Quarter. Can't turn them in<br>until after "A Posh Reception".</p><p>THE KIKIMORE CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Kikimores are the easiest monster to find this chapter. They will pop up all<br>over the place in the Trade Quarter during the evenings. They also now roam<br>the swamp forest.<br>-Take them to Velerad at the guard tower in Trade Quarter. Have to turn them<br>in after "A Posh Reception".</p><p>THE RING<br>-Starts from a Distressed Merchant at the Dike. He wanders around the area<br>throughout the day and wants a ring found.<br>-Ring is on a corpse near the Shrine of Melintele in the swamp forest. Should<br>be about a half a dozen bloedzuigers around the corpse holding the ring.<br>-Take the ring back to the merchant.</p><p>* THE SOURCE *<br>Either Shani or Triss won't speak to Geralt in a friendly manner for the<br>majority of the rest of the game after this quest.<br>-Automatic quest given by Triss during the start of Chapter 3.<br>-Place the three sensors with the help of the Quest Track. The first goes<br>to the center of town where all the traders migrate. The second goes to the<br>cemetary, and the last goes right by the sewer entrance in Temple Quarter.<br>-Return to Triss and she'll say that little Alvin is the problem.<br>-Go to the hospital in Temple District. Dandelion shows up once inside and says<br>someone ran off with Alvin.<br>-Follow Dandelion to the hideout and murder everyone inside. Afterwards,<br>Dandelion is going to come in to get Alvin.&#xA0; Now the choice comes. Either send<br>Alvin to Triss, or send him to Shani.&#xA0; Whichever one is choosen, the other girl<br>is not going to like it at all and won't be pleasant with Geralt for the<br>majority of the game. Whichever one is chosen will also help out during the<br>Epilogue, will show up in "Identity", and a second sex card can be gotten from<br>her. It will also slightly affect a quest in chapter 4.<br>-After making the selection, Dandelion will usher Alvin out and more goons show<br>up.&#xA0; Slaughter them.<br>-Go to whoever was chosen and they'll want the other girl told that Alvin is<br>with them. Pretty much, they are using Alvin like a trophy saying whoever has<br>him has Geralt and what better way to start a family with a sterile witcher<br>than with a ready-made child.<br>-Taking Triss will require telling Shani and then going back to Triss. After<br>the dialogue with her, head downstairs to run into Dandelion. If Shani is the<br>chosen girl, directly after asking her about Alvin, head downstairs to meet<br>Dandelion.<br>-Now both women will want a ring as a show of love. Dandelion will wisk Gerlat<br>off to the bar with him and Zoltan. Either the Hairy Bear or New Narakort will<br>be the drinking location depending on the choice of women. Then its time to<br>decide whether to give them the ring or not.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;=Shani wants a Silver Amber Ring as a show of love<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;=Triss wants a Gold Ruby Signet as a show of love<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Alvin may need to be talked to a few times before they'll accept the<br>ring. Once they do take it, a second sex card will be had.&#xA0; To know if Alvin<br>has been spoken to in the right manner, talk to the girls. Shani will say<br>something about how Alvin looks at Geralt like a father and Triss will say how<br>good Geralt is with him. It could vary though. Simplest way is try giving them<br>the ring.</p><p>THE UNFORGIVEN<br>-Quest starts from Triss after finishing "Lock and Key".<br>-Talk to Declan and he'll say to convince either Yaevinn or Seigfried to help.<br>Remember the bank job?&#xA0; Whatever side was helped then, time to call that favor<br>in.<br>-Yaevinn can be found at Vivaldi's house, while Seigfried is at the Order as<br>usual.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE!&#xA0; Past this is the point of no return. Once going ahead, the<br>Chapter is going to run toward the end. So finish any quests that can be done<br>now. Triss will also give a warning before continuing.</p><p>-After talking to the chosen affiliate, head over and have a talk with Triss at<br>home.&#xA0; She's going to say that once the meeting starts, there may be no turning<br>back, and she's right. This is the last opportunity to clear up any quests for<br>this chapter.<br>-When ready, tell Triss and then go to New Narakort. Also, if "The Source"<br>hasn't been finished yet, she won't let Geralt go to the meeting.<br>-Surprise, there's an ambush coming. If Vincent was saved, he'll be there to<br>throw a little help. If he was killed, an ambush by guards accusing Geralt of<br>murdering Vincent will be waiting!<br>-After disposing of the ambush, head on upstairs to chat with Triss and get<br>rushed off to the next destination. If Seigfried is the helper, there will be<br>some rather comical chat. He isn't too enthusiastic about the whole<br>teleportation thing.<br>-Now once inside the Salamandra base, blast the roots apart with Aard and<br>commence with the killing till meeting up with Seigfreid/Yaevinn again.<br>-Time to activate the portal and let the order or nonhumans in.&#xA0; The stone is<br>actually right around the right wall.&#xA0; If the large force directly ahead is<br>approached, then there will be non-stop fighting and actually getting the portal<br>open will be a huge hastle.&#xA0; So snag the stone after killing the mage guarding<br>it and get the portal open before taking on the force ahead.<br>-Once the portal is open, fight over to Azar and the Professor. Once again,<br>Geralt gets some alone time. Its short lived though because its Professor<br>hunting season, and he doesn't have anywhere to run.<br>-After chasing the professor down, there will be a nice battle with salamandra<br>thugs, Professor, and even kikimore warriors. No problem though, just go group<br>steel targeting Professor the whole time. Everything else will be eradicated<br>in the process.<br>-Now comes the fun part after the floor collapses and the kikimore queen<br>finishes off Professor. Portions of the tunnel need to be collapsed behind<br>Geralt using Aard to block the Kikimore Queen. Why? Because she kills in one<br>hit. Be careful not to collapse the tunnel on Geralt.<br>-If not moving fast enough, there's a chance of getting swarmed by Kikimores<br>and dying. But the body to the left between the second and third set of beams<br>to crumble on the way out really needs looted. It has a nice rune on it, that<br>being the Moon Rune.&#xA0; Grab it and take off to the right. Its sort of dangerous<br>to use Aard at this juncture because the ceiling above needs to be collapsed<br>onto the queen. Once out from underneath the area with the dozen beams, when<br>the queen breaks into the large hall, let an Aard or 2 go and then back up. The<br>ceiling will crumble on top of the queen killing her. Loot her body and head up<br>the path. Now off to Chapter 4.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-There is a second, easier way to go about the tunnel collapse. Run past<br>the first set of beams, but level the second set and stop. The queen won't<br>attack until an invisible line has been crossed just past the third set of beams<br>when the room opens up. The corpse can be looted at leisure and the kikimores<br>can be obliterated for some extra experience. Once their ranks have been<br>considerably thinned, head past the last set of beams and to the right. When the<br>queen comes into the main hall, let an Aard or two go and then either roll back<br>or turn and run back the tunnel a bit till the ceiling collapses on top of her.<br>It won't actually come down until just before she reaches the tunnel.</p><p>THE VIZIMAN CONNECTION<br>-This quest comes after finishing "Following the Thread"<br>-This area is located in the sewers. Just use the map and Quest Track to find<br>the location. Jethro gives the key to open the grate to access the area.<br>-After laying down some authority on Gellert, time to travel back to Jethro at<br>his normal location in the dungeon prison.<br>-Finishing this quest also updates "Witchers' Secrets" and "Lock and Key".</p><p>THE WYVERN CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Innkeeper of New Narakort wants 3 portions of wyvern meat. They can be found<br>near the druid grove in the Swamp. There will be plenty of them during the<br>hunt for the unique monster Moa.<br>-Turn in the meat to him to collect the reward.</p><p>WANTED (Ongoing Quest from Chapter 1)<br>-Should be up to the part of "A Reward for the Broaches"<br>-This quest will update during encounters with Leuvaarden. Its pretty much<br>just a quest that runs beside the others. No real attention is needed for it.<br>It will finish up this chapter though right before the end.</p><p>WITCHERS' SECRETS (Ongoing Quest from Chapter 1)<br>-Should be up to Azar Javed portion with salamandra feeling at home in Vizima.<br>-Updates by finishing "The Viziman Connection" - Will show as Salamandra in the<br>Temple...<br>-Updates by finishing "Diplomacy and Hunting" - Will show as The Salamandra Camp<br>in...<br>-When both of the other quests are finished, this will be at Destroyed Cells<br>phase.<br>-After the confrontation with Professor and the kikimore queen, Geralt will be<br>wisked off to the next chapter and this will update again.</p><p>WON'T HURT A BIT<br>-This quest carries over into chapter 4 and can't be finished until chapter 5.<br>-Starts from the dentist Zahin Schmartz that has taken up residence in Raymond's<br>place. He can be found loitering around Shani's home in Temple Quarter during<br>the day. The items he'll take are as follows:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Barghest teeth &gt; Pays 50 orens &gt; Its actually the whole Barghest head.<br>These are only available in Chapter 1 but fortunately, it isn't required to<br>finish the quest.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The Jaw &gt; Pays 150 &gt; This is an item from a Cemetaur. They are located<br>in numerous places throughout chapter 3 and on. Easiest place to get them is<br>the swamp forest in the evening near the toppled mage tower.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Fleder Fangs &gt; Pays 100 &gt; Naturally, these come from Fleders found in<br>different places throughout chapter 2 and on.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The Beast's Teeth &gt; Pays 25 orens &gt; These are drops from numerous<br>creatures including wolves and dogs. Can get them in just about any chapter.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Alp Fangs &gt; Pays 150 orens &gt; These creatures do not show up before<br>chapter 3.&#xA0; And there's a possibly none will be seen during chapter 3 either. 1<br>can be had during this chapter if the quest "Echoes of Yesterday" is not taken<br>and Geralt sides with the Scoia'tael during "Gold Rush". The alp can be found<br>in the adjacent room from the teleporter in the sewers.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Devourer Teeth &gt; Pays 125 orens &gt; These cannot be found anywhere but<br>chapter 4, so put one in storage till chapter 5.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Zdenek's Tooth &gt; Pays 250 orens &gt; This is acquired from the fistfighter<br>Zdenek in the swamp cemetary during chapter 5 after beating him twice. And in<br>order to fight him, Geralt needs to be trouncing the local brawler during each<br>chapter in "Fistfight".</p><p>===============================================================================<br>Chapter 4++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>===============================================================================<br>Note on this chapter.&#xA0; The quest steps can get quite jumbled because there's<br>many instances of forced dialogue.</p><p>If the vodyanoi beastiary entry is still needed, talk to the female innkeeper.<br>Ask her some questions and then run through them till there's a chance to ask<br>her directly about the vodyanoi.&#xA0; After the discussion, the beastiary entry for<br>them will update saving a little cash and hastle of hunting the book down. And<br>for some strange reason, the female innkeeper only charges 5 orens a night, but<br>the male innkeeper charges 7.&#xA0; Mind boggling.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;+Monster Hunts+<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;THE VODYAN PRIEST<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-This creature, named Teyu, is found in the Fields a little north of the<br>druid circle.&#xA0; Comes with 2 other Vodyanoi.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Careful with this guy. He heals the other 2 and himself, so it might<br>be best to kill his friends first or just go with group steel style. The<br>Vodyanoi are not sensitive to silver so the steel sword will dish out nearly<br>twice the amount of a silver blade with the same damage. Switch to fast style<br>once Teyu is alone. When his head is taken, return it to the town chief for the<br>800 oren reward.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;THE ANCIENT CEMETAUR<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-This guy, Ureus, is inhabiting the crypt in the the Fields.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-He really isn't anything special.&#xA0; Shouldn't give too much trouble.<br>Just go with strong silver.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-After he's dead, take the head to the town chief for the 800 oren<br>reward.</p><p>A GAME OF DICE (Ongoing Quest)<br>-There is several people to play dice against during this chapter depending on<br>which phase of dice poker is open.<br>-Sharpers include Dandelion who can be found at the Inn, a wraith that can be<br>found by clicking a skeleton at the storybook ruins. Its also possible to be<br>forced into a game with the wraith if Alvin was sent to Triss in chapter 3.<br>Finally there's Chireadan at the elf cave in Lakeside.<br>-Professionals that can be played include the Hermit in the Feilds, Julian, and<br>Tobias.</p><p>ALVIN<br>-Automatically get this quest on the first trip to Murky Water. Dandelion will<br>be waiting at the entrance.<br>-Find Alvin in town at Alina's house. Upon entering the house, there will be<br>forced dialogue with her. It'll open the quest "The Heat of the Day".<br>-Have a chat with Alvin and then speak with Julian at the Inn. Its possible to<br>run across Dandelion first in a forced dialogue. He'll hand over a necklace to<br>give to Alvin. There are 2 possible locations for Alvin to be at depending on<br>whether he was sent to Triss or Shani in chapter 3.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If sent with Triss, Alvin is off playing with a wraith at the storybook<br>ruins.&#xA0; Save the game before getting too close.&#xA0; The wraith won't let him go<br>unless beaten in a game of dice. The wraith also counts toward "Dice Poker:<br>The Sharper".<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If the Shani path was taken, Alvin should be found near the river with<br>a dog. Nothing special, just have to kill a devourer whether night or day.<br>-Once Alvin is safe, he'll go into demon-boy mode and spout some garbage. "The<br>Heat of the Day" should update.<br>-When all 5 pieces of Alina's mirror are found, Alvin is going to force<br>dialogue yet again. There is a choice of three things to tell him. The answer<br>has no consequences.<br>-The next update comes after killing Dagon. When going back to Lakeside, Alvin<br>will be waiting. He'll talk about becoming a Witcher and Geralt can answer with<br>a few things.<br>-An update will come again after telling Lady of the Lake that Dagon is dead.<br>-This quest has nothing more that can be done till the skirmish in the village<br>between scoia'tael and the order.</p><p>ARMOR<br>-This quest begins with Berengar when speaking to him at his fire after leaving<br>the crypt. Make sure to get the piece of armor from the sarcophagus inside the<br>crypt.<br>-Also, this quest will carry over into the next chapter. The most that can be<br>done is to get 1 piece of the armor from the crypt and a little information<br>about it.<br>-Have a chat with the elven craftsman and the blacksmith in town. After that,<br>this quest goes on hold till Chapter 5.</p><p>BERENGAR'S SECRET (Ongoing Quest)<br>-This should be at Berengar is Alive<br>-This time, a meeting with the fabled Berengar will occur. He is located in<br>the crypt, and he'll tell of a nifty suit of armor that can be made in the next<br>chapter.<br>-After chatting with the Lady of the Lake during "The Path's of Destiny", head<br>back to Berengar at his campfire.&#xA0; When talking to him this time, he divulges<br>that he actually cooperated with Salamandra for a nice payday.<br>-The next update comes after killing Dagon and informing Lady of the Lake about<br>the successful mission.&#xA0; This quest then goes on hold till late in Chapter 5.</p><p>DAILY BREAD<br>-Quest starts from Toruviel in the elf cave.&#xA0; Yep, same chick that gave<br>Dandelion his lute.<br>-Very simple quest. Just go snag five loaves of bread from town. She gives<br>20 orens and it'll run 25, but that shouldn't be a problem. There are actually<br>4 loaves of bread in the wardrobe inside the baker's house. Just buy 1 more for<br>a total of 5 to get the favorable reply from her.<br>-When returning, there's a choice of whether or not to give her 4 loaves or 5.<br>Give only 4 and she'll call you greedy. Giving 5 gets the favorable reply.<br>-Bring some chunks of meat when turning this quest in.&#xA0; Its possible to feed<br>all the elves if the desire hits after turning the bread in. They tend to get<br>hostile if given fruit, fish, or candy.<br>-Feed the elven woman in the cave to get her sex card.&#xA0; She's also rather<br>comical.&#xA0; Give food to the other elves and most will tell of the mandrake root<br>and han fiber.&#xA0; Chances are they're already in the ingredients list so its<br>pretty much just a whim to feed them.</p><p>DICE POKER: THE PROFESSIONAL (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Professionals that can be played include Julian, Tobias and the Hermit.<br>-Julian and Tobias can only be played if needing at least 1 more win. Neither<br>one will play Geralt if this quest is already finished.<br>-The Hermit is doing his thing in the Feilds.&#xA0; Julian is lounging around the<br>Inn and Tobias is either in his house during the day, or Celina's at night.</p><p>DICE POKER: THE SHARPER<br>-There is 3 individuals to play in order to progress this quest: Dandelion, a<br>Wraith, and Chireadan.<br>-Dandelion can be found lounging around the Inn.<br>-The wraith can be found at the storybook ruins. If Trish was taken as the love<br>interest, the wraith can be played anytime after running into him during the<br>quest, "Alvin".&#xA0; If Shani was taken as the love interest, he can only be played<br>at night, using the skeleton on the ground to summon him.<br>-Ask Chireadan in the elf cave if he needs help.&#xA0; This will open the dice poker<br>option for him.</p><p>FISTFIGHT (Ongoing Quest)<br>-At this time, Fat Fred, Butter Bean, and Andrewe Gablodda should be beaten.<br>-Head on over to the Inn and have a throw down with The Rock.&#xA0; After beating<br>him, he'll give a choice between meteorite steel, a rune, or gold.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;meteorite steel = Yellow Meteorite &gt; 20% damage and critical effects of<br>pain, stun and precise hit +30%<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;rune = Sun Rune &gt; Increases opponents sensitivity to silver<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;gold = 500 orens plus the original wager of 500<br>-That's it for this chapter.&#xA0; Quest can finally be completed next chapter.</p><p>* FREE ELVES *<br>Choices on this quest will decide alliances for the rest of the game and the<br>ending.&#xA0; And the choices possible are affected by the previous decision at the<br>bank in Chapter 3.<br>-White Rayla starts this quest after returning to Lakeside from slaying Dagon<br>and telling Lady of the Lake about it.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If the scoia'tael were chosen at the bank, the opportunity to side with<br>them for the rest of the game is given as well as the chance to go neutral.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If the order was chosen at the bank, the opportunity to side with them<br>for the rest of the game is given as well as the chance to go neutral.<br>-Upon entering Murky Water, there is a forced dialogue with Dandelion.&#xA0; He'll<br>say that Toruviel and the other elves have pretty much taken the village<br>hostage, along with Alvin.&#xA0; So now come the negotiations.&#xA0; Head into town to<br>chat with Toruviel.<br>-Go into the center of the group of elves and approach Alvin to start things<br>going.&#xA0; During the conversation with him, three choices come up.&#xA0; They really<br>don't matter, but its best to go with the theme of Geralt's alliance.&#xA0; It will<br>also update "Alvin".&#xA0; When finished with him, Toruviel makes an appearance and<br>can now be spoken to.<br>-When speaking to Toruviel, there comes a choice.&#xA0; Selecting to tell them White<br>Rayla wants them to lay down arms if the order has been sided with or telling<br>them to let the hostages go if the scoia'tael were sided with will lead to a<br>talk with Dandelion and also another choice:&#xA0; Grab Alvin and run, or stay and<br>help whichever side was chosen at the bank.&#xA0; Choosing to grab Alvin and run<br>makes enemies on both sides and its a battle royale with Geralt in the middle,<br>putting Geralt at a neutral stance.&#xA0; Chosing to help whichever side was selected<br>during the bank heist will align Geralt with them and make an enemy of the other<br>side.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Regardless of the choice, the available options and what needs doing in<br>Chapter 5 will change depending on Geralt's stance.<br>-Once everyone that needs to be is dead, head toward the boat at the Fisher<br>King's place to progress.&#xA0; Talk to White Rayla to learn she didn't go back on<br>her word.&#xA0; Trot over to the boat and give Dandelion the good news that Alvin has<br>finally vanished and then head to the Dike.<br>-After going to Vizima, Chapter 5 doesn't quite start, but to help clear up<br>quest confusion and clutter, this guide skips to Chapter 5 once back at the<br>Dike.</p><p>HUNTING THE WILD HUNT<br>-This quest is given by the Hermit in the fields. He'll also tell of the holy<br>grail, which is part of the path to getting the sex card for Lady of the Lake.<br>-Pick up the mandrake root from the barrow's.<br>-Head over to the druid ruins at night. Just use the Quest Track.&#xA0; To make the<br>fight a lot easier, use specter oil on the silver sword and go with group style.<br>This fight can suck a lot.&#xA0; There's a chance the specters will nail Geralt 2 or<br>3 times in a row with pain, so save before attempting it. They also have a<br>tendency to dodge group style, especially if one is coming into being. And they<br>must be killed in the druid circle.<br>-Light the mandrake root on the druid lantern, then kill 3 wraiths.&#xA0; When they<br>die, light another mandrake root and kill the next 3.&#xA0; Repeat till 9 are killed<br>in total.<br>-Go back to the Hermit for the reward which is 1 of 3 things.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-1. Book on vampires - chances are this is already in the beastiary. Its<br>just a monster journal on alps, bruxae, fleders, and garkains.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-2. A very lovely little hut for some R&amp;R right next to his. Not really<br>any point to this one.&#xA0; Becomes totally useless after this chapter and the time<br>spent in the Feilds is short. The cabin does contain a centipede rattle, Rivian<br>Program book, some stammelford's dust for bombs and a few other peices of<br>worthless food.&#xA0; Not really a great reward.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-3. Wreath of Immortelles &gt; This is used at the end of "The Heat of the<br>Day" to free Celina.&#xA0; If going neutral and she's given this item, she will help<br>out later during the Epilogue.<br>-He also gives a Pouch of Salt (ring item) that wards off wraiths.</p><p>IDENTITY (Ongoing Quest)<br>-This quest is kind of impossible to track.&#xA0; It all depends on choices<br>throughout the game. Several more updates will come through conversations with<br>Alvin and completion of other quests during this chapter.</p><p>OLD HABITS DIE HARD<br>-Pick this quest up from Naiad, a water nymph. She looks just like the dryad<br>Morenn.<br>-Follow the Quest Track to hunt down the drowners that swiped her necklace. The<br>first group can be found near the elf cave.<br>-Second group is located on Black Tern Island.&#xA0; A stop is required at the house<br>next to the river to get the Fisher King's approval to use his boat.&#xA0; After he<br>mumbles a response, head on over there.&#xA0; Lady of the Lake inhabits the area so<br>have a chat with her. And kill the basilisk's to the left of the Lady of the<br>Lake. They're hiding behind a rock wall.&#xA0; This is the only place in the entire<br>chapter they can be found and the Basilisk Hide is needed for a notice board<br>quest.&#xA0; Not to mention, they're good for about 1400 exp a kill.<br>-The last group is in Murky Waters between the village and the collapsed bridge.<br>Once that group dies, Zephyr will pop up.&#xA0; Kill him and loot the pendant.&#xA0; He's<br>really no different than a normal drowner aside from him being able to take a<br>little extra abuse, and hit a bit harder. Fast silver will make short work of<br>him.<br>-Naiad can be found past the Lady of the Lake statue. 3 choices are given as a<br>reward:<br>1. Book on the Vodyanoi - Just a bestiary of them<br>2. Life-long healer - Not as good as it sounds.&#xA0; She'll only heal vitality. She<br>does nothing for toxcicity.<br>3. Earth rune<br>She'll also give an amulet (actually a ring slot item) to protect against<br>drowners.&#xA0; It just keeps them from swarming Geralt. If they are close, combat<br>will still engage though they usually won't attack unless provoked.</p><p>RIPPLES<br>-Pick this quest up from the Vodyanoi Priest standing around the altar to Lady<br>of the Lake or get it from Fisher King.<br>-Head down to the crypt and finally come face to face with Berengar. "Berengar's<br>Secret" will update and a new quest "The Paths of Destiny" will begin.<br>-After following him to his campfire and running through the dialogue, he'll<br>concede the quest he was hired for.&#xA0; Now a chat with each of the factional<br>leaders, Julian and the friendly little Vodyanoi Priest, is not required because<br>the rewards they give are terrible in comparison to what the Lady of the Lake<br>will give if her method is taken.<br>So, Decision Time. Its a toss up of chosing Julian, the Vodyanoi, or Lady of the<br>Lake to end the squabble between humans and fish people.&#xA0; Listed are the<br>options available, requirements, and rewards of the choices.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Head on over to the priest for a talk.&#xA0; If he's not there, wipe out<br>the dagon worshippers by the fisher king's house and down by the elven cave.<br>Then go into the fisher king's house and back out. He should be available now.<br>He says to "dislove big blood cow" on the altar. Not a good idea to sacrifice<br>the village's prize cow. But if taking this path, ask the priest about the cow<br>and he'll say to use fruits and nuts.&#xA0; If no fruits and nuts are onhand, go to<br>village where they are scattered about in houses. Talk to Strawberry (the cow)<br>and give her the fruits and nuts.&#xA0; Then lead her over to the altar at Black Tern<br>Island.&#xA0; Once there, she can be killed.&#xA0; For all this work, he gives the<br>spectacular steel sword, Ceremonial Sword of Deithwen. It has -30% damage and<br>critical chance of disarm by 60% and precise hit by 30%. A truly terrible sword.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Take a walk over to see Julian.&#xA0; He says to sacrifice Dagon's<br>followers on the altar.&#xA0; Not a bad idea and he offers a diamond for success. If<br>going this route, simply go to Black Tern Island where a Dagon Acolyte is<br>pacing around the altar. When he's attacked, 4 worshippers and a priest will<br>spawn. As soon as the Acolyte dies, Dagon shows up whether the worshippers and<br>priest are dead or not. If they are still alive, they'll slowly walk back to<br>where they came from and vanish into the water. The reward for going this path<br>is a Huge Diamond. Julian will buy it back for 300 orens while others will pay<br>only 120.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-The Lady of the Lake offers a simpler, no slaying option. Get a trinket<br>from the vodyanoi priest and another from Julian that symbolizes their wish for<br>peace. Her statue explains the original exchange of gifts between the villagers<br>and the vodyanoi. So from the priest get a golden bracelet. From Julian, get an<br>alabaster figure. Once the items are retrieved, take them to her and she'll give<br>a drop of her blood to place on the altar which will summon Dagon.&#xA0; The reward<br>for working with her is a Silver tablet to spend in Geralt's abilities.</p><p>-Regardless of the choice, the fight with Dagon can be tricky because mortals<br>can't kill gods. Like the beastiary says, his worshippers are his only weakness,<br>so they need to die. It can be difficult to chain attacks depending on the<br>camera angle. If problems persist, tap forward and leap over them or back them<br>off with Aard. The fight itself isn't too terrible. Take a swallow and tawny<br>owl potion before beginning. Applying diamond dust or hanged man's venom to the<br>steel blade will speed the fight up as well as drinking down a wolverine potion.<br>If looking to make it a lot easier, get a stack of Samum bombs. If Geralt is<br>quick enough, 2 worshippers at a time can be slain with the use of one Samum<br>bomb. It takes about a dozen dead worshippers before Dagon goes down. Another<br>point to take into account is that group style will not work. If Dagon is<br>within striking distance while using group, it immediately stops because he<br>can't be hurt. At best, one swing can be achieved by knocking him down with<br>Aard. Best to use fast steel. His followers really don't have that much health.</p><p>-Depending on who's method of resolving the conflict was taken, this goes two<br>ways. If Julian or the priest were taken, go talk to them. Afterwards, Geralt<br>can ask if anyone was asking about him which should lead him to the Fisher King<br>who will point back to Lady of the Lake.&#xA0; She should now be wandering around<br>Dagon's altar.<br>-If the Lady of the Lake was told of Dagon's demise, she'll be in the same area<br>as normal.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE:&#xA0; After killing Dagon, regardless of the chosen method, if the<br>Lady of the Lake is told of his demise, The end of the chapter begins and it<br>won't be possible to speak to any villager and Lady of the Lake vanishes.<br>Chapter 5 is much more linear and somewhat pushes to a conclusion more rapidly<br>than other chapters. Storage is also cut off with only the chance at the very<br>end of this chapter to use it. So now is a good opportunity to visit town and<br>make up potions, finish quests, or whatever needs done before seeing Lady of the<br>Lake and telling her of Dagon's untimely demise.</p><p>-Once ready, return to Lady of the Lake and start the end of the chapter. There<br>is also an update to "The Path of Destiny".</p><p>SMALL PROBLEMS<br>-Starts with Mason Ham at the collapsed bridge.<br>-He offers to trade services for figuring out a way to drive off Griggs, which<br>sort of resemble keebler elves. He suggests visiting the witch for a method to<br>get rid of them. Its possible to already have the harness, which will jump the<br>quest to instructions on seeing a healer. Its also possible to already have the<br>four-leaf clover which after visiting the healer, the quest will jump to giving<br>it to Ham.<br>-Either way, its off to the healer hut where instructions are given to find a<br>cat harness in the crypt in the Fields. The cat harness is all the way in the<br>back on a mini totem poll called a Santon. Return to the healer and she'll say<br>to leave it at the Santon near the bridge as an offering. The Santon is<br>surrounded by more keebler elves and is to the left of the bridge.<br>-Now armed with the four-leaf clover, hand it over to Ham and take the choice<br>of a book on specters, Ham's son, or 400 orens.</p><p>TEMPTATION<br>-Starts with the blacksmith's wife.<br>-Talk to the wife and she'll say that her husband is having a bit of fun with a<br>succubus. She wants 9 shimmering dusts from noonwraiths. Her offer is the herb<br>book, Plants of Barren Lands.<br>-Now, talk to the blacksmith. Turns out he was eavesdropping and really doesn't<br>want to stop frolicking with the succubus. He offers red meteorite steel or 500<br>gold.&#xA0; In return, he wants devourer shadow dust.<br>-Taking the offer from the blacksmith cancels the contract with the wife. There<br>is no detriment to chosing one over the other.<br>-Both devourers and noonwraiths can be found in The Feilds. Noonwraiths during<br>the day, and devourers at night.</p><p>THE ALP CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Collect 5 Alp fangs and bring them to the village chief.&#xA0; Alps can be found<br>in the crypt with Berengar as well as the crypt in the Fields.<br>-Take them to the village chief Tobias.</p><p>THE BASILISK CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Collect 3 basilisk hides and take them to Julian at the Inn.&#xA0; Basilisks can<br>only be found on Black Tern Island to the left after crossing over to the main<br>island.&#xA0; They are near the circle of magic and can range from 2 to upwards of 6<br>at any one time.<br>-Run them to Julian at the Inn for the reward.</p><p>THE DEVOURER CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Collect 10 teeth. Devourer's sometimes waddle along the road in between the<br>village and the broken bridge, but mostly get them in the Fields at night.<br>-Take them to the healer's hut who is in a house directly next to the Inn.</p><p>THE GIANT CENTIPEDE CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-These annoying bugs can be found around the storybook ruins where Alvin was<br>playing with a wraith if Triss was/is the love interest. Careful with them,<br>they like to gang up in groups of three and can break chains by going into<br>the ground. Strong silver works well.<br>-Once 4 have tasted dirt for the last time, run the carapaces to the elf<br>craftsman at the cave in Lakeside.</p><p>THE HEAT OF THE DAY<br>-Started by Alina<br>-Head over to the Inn where an arguement is taking place between Celina and<br>Julian. When allowed, approach Celina and she'll go off on a rant. If she wasn't<br>approached earlier, eventually she'll straight out proposition Geralt and ask<br>for a ring. Give her any ring and she'll give up her sex card. Now have a chat<br>with Julian who should be back inside the Inn.<br>-If the quest "Alvin" isn't far enough along, this one goes on hold.&#xA0; Follow<br>"Alvin" until he rattles off a dream about Alina and then switches to the super<br>scary Alvin voice and runs off.<br>-Now that the annoyance of Alvin is out of the way...for now...head over to the<br>Inn to chat with Julian who is a wee bit disturbed.&#xA0; He should be outside.<br>-Seems Alina went for a walk and hasn't shown back up.&#xA0; For some fun, go find<br>Adam in town and talk to him. Afterwards, journey to the Fields, where Alvin is<br>going to follow like a stray mutt.&#xA0; Get use to it. He's going to be doing<br>annoying for the rest of the chapter.<br>-After finding Alina in her psuedo human form, and watching Adam go middle ages<br>on Celina, head back to the Inn to deliver the news to Julian. On the way there<br>Adam will pop up and confess to killing Celina in a fit of anger.<br>-While talking to Julian, there's an option to tell him how Celina died. Either<br>turn Adam in, or just blow the question off.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If the question is blown off, Adam's house remains open and he'll be<br>sitting in the Fields. And this quest can take a completely different turn<br>later on depending on whether Abigail was saved or not back in chapter 1.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If he is turned in for killing Celina, he'll be arrested and his house<br>gets locked.<br>-Find someone with knowledge of curses.&#xA0; Two guesses at who that is.&#xA0; Nope, not<br>the Hermit or the healer.&#xA0; Its Dandelion.<br>-After consulting with Dandelion, the Fields need to be scoured to find the<br>broken pieces of the mirror. These are held by Midday Brides in a couple<br>locations.<br>-First bride is on top the old mill. Take the stairs up and then there's a pile<br>of barrels and boxes to walk up.<br>-Second bride is hanging out around a campfire where the vodyan priest, Teyu is<br>or was depending on if he's been hunted yet.<br>-Third bride is kicking it at the druid circle where the wraiths for "Hunting<br>the Wild Hunt" took place.<br>-Fourth bride is standing around just outside the hermit's little homestead.<br>-And the last bride is just standing around near the passage to Lakeside.<br>-Now that the mirror portions have been collected, find a craftsman to put them<br>together. Employ either the town's blacksmith or the elven craftsman. Both will<br>assemble the mirror for 100 orens.<br>-Armed with the mirror, go back to the tree at the rasberry patch in the Fields<br>during the day. Have a chat with Alina and she'll remember who she is. Still<br>doesn't understand that she's dead but she knows who she is. So back toward town<br>to learn some folklore.<br>-Talk with Berengar and he'll advise talking to Lady of the Lake or a diviner.<br>Julian will also advise speaking with Lady of the Lake or a healer.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If Adam wasn't turned in and Abigail was killed back in chapter 1, Lady<br>of the Lake will say Geralt has slain an innocent. Guess Abigail really was the<br>lesser evil. Lady will go on to say that only the dead can hear the dead. Head<br>back over to the Fields and find Adam. Ask him if he wants to help Alina.<br>Naturally he does, though his devotion is a bit frightening.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Once the dialogue between Adam and Alina finishes, with the nice cut<br>scene following that, head back to Julian to give him the news and finish the<br>quest with a 400 oren reward.<br>-If Adam is arrested or if Abigail is safe and sound, the quest will continue<br>without suicide.&#xA0; Go see the healer who will suggest a "poetic argument" or Lady<br>of the Lake who will say that poetry will halt Alina long enough to see her<br>damned sister. All in all, its unanimous that Dandelion finally has something to<br>do other than providing comic relief. Also, this entire step can be skipped by<br>going straight to Dandelion.<br>IMPORTANT NOTE:&#xA0; If wanting to end this quest on the best possible outcome, go<br>to the Hermit in the Fields and complete "Hunting the Wild Hunt". Take the<br>Wreath of Immortelles at the end as the reward.<br>-Now that Dandelion's skills have been employed for something more than bedding<br>the local ladies, head over to the field before dusk.&#xA0; Meditate at one of the<br>campfires near the rasberry patch and roll the timer 1 hour back from dusk.<br>Dandelion will come running right about 6:30. Talk to him and he'll start his<br>poem that Geralt is now a part of. The answers to his questions are "The<br>Deceased" and "A Ghost". It may be necessary to wait an entire day. Dandelion<br>sometimes won't show up the same day he's propositioned for a poem.<br>-Now that frees Alina, but there's still the question of Celina. If "Hunting the<br>Wild Hunt" was completed and the wreath taken as reward, talk to the nightwraith<br>(Celina) that will now be wandering at the tree.&#xA0; Offer help and she'll notice<br>the wreath, immediately asking to be crowned.&#xA0; Give it to her and she vanishes.<br>With both wraiths put down, go see Julian to finish the quest.</p><p>* THE PATHS OF DESTINY *<br>-Quest starts after finding Berengar in the crypt at lakeside. Just follow him<br>around the crypt for now.<br>-After killing 3 groups of monsters, he'll finally say to come outside and sit<br>by his fire to talk.&#xA0; Be sure to loot the crypt first.&#xA0; There's a piece of armor<br>in a sarcophagus needed next chapter for some very nice gear.<br>-Go outside and talk to Berengar at his fire.&#xA0; Go through all the chat and there<br>will be updates on "Alvin", "Ripples", "The Paths of Destiny", and opens a new<br>quest "Armor". If "The Heat of the Day" isn't far enough along, the "Alvin"<br>update may not come yet. The same goes for "Ripples".<br>-The next step is to take a jaunt over to see Lady of the Lake.&#xA0; Tell her she<br>looks pensive to get the update.<br>-Back to Berengar for a conversation about destiny.&#xA0; This little heart to heart<br>will also update "Berengar's Secret".<br>-After playing the worlds smallest violin for Berengar, go back to the Lady of<br>the Lake and let her know that he's about as useful as a bag full of toenail<br>clippings.<br>-The Lady of the Lake offers a reward later when the right time comes. And that<br>time is after killing Dagon.&#xA0; And that reward is the very useful Aerondight,<br>which is quite possibly the best silver sword. And finally an update for "Alvin"<br>as well.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;=See "Ripples" for notes on fighting Dagon and information about the<br>progression of this chapter.<br>IMPORTANT NOTE:&#xA0; The choice on this next part will effect a major fight later in<br>Chapter 5.<br>-After killing Dagon and telling Lady of the Lake of it, she'll give Geralt his<br>reward which is Aerondight, a silver sword with +60 damage, +10% attack, and<br>+50% chance of critical effects: pain, blinding, incineration, and Precise Hit.<br>On the way back to the boat to leave Black Tern Island, Berengar shows up.<br>Decision time.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If he's answered with the top choice both times, he'll fork over the<br>Dagon Sap recipe, The Book of the Full Moon, and a letter. He'll also pop up at<br>a most useful time later on in chapter 5!<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now, if the bottom choice of calling him a traitor is selected, he'll<br>take offense and a fight ensues.&#xA0; Berengar is no slouch as he'll attack at the<br>same time he's being attacked.&#xA0; He is rather easy to stun with Aard or a Samum<br>bomb and has very little health. Once he's dead, loot him to get his letter,<br>the Dagon sap recipe, The Book of the Full Moon, and a nice chunk of change.<br>Naturally, if he's killed, he won't be showing up in chapter 5.</p><p>-Regardless of the choice, this quest will finish and "Berengar's Secret" will<br>update. Whether killing him or not, his quest won't finish just yet. This quest,<br>however, will complete after the choice is made.</p><p>THE ROYAL WYVERN CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-The innkeeper wants some royal wyvern eggs.&#xA0; If some were saved from hunting<br>Moa on the last chapter, just pull them out of storage and hand them over.&#xA0; If<br>none were saved, head to Black Tern Island.&#xA0; Many royals roaming around there.<br>They can also be found in the Fields as well.<br>-Once three are sitting in inventory, take them to the male innkeeper in Murky<br>Water for a reward.</p><p>WITCHERS' SECRETS (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Should be at the phase: Second Wind<br>-This quest will update during the course of other quests. No special attention<br>is needed.</p><p>WON'T HURT A BIT (Ongoing Quest)<br>-There isn't anyway to turn in teeth this chapter, so just collect some. A<br>devourer and alp tooth should be needed. Put them in storage so they aren't<br>accidentally used up in alchemy or thrown away. Devourers don't appear anywhere<br>but this chapter so if they get used up, tossed out, or whatever, the quest<br>can't be finished and the easiest way to obtain the best steel sword is lost.</p><p>====================================================================<br>Chapter 5+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>====================================================================<br>For the sake of confusion, this quest assumes chapter 5 has started immediately<br>after landing at the Dike.&#xA0; In reality, chapter 4 continues until the cut scene<br>with King Foltest in Old Vizima.</p><p>Once land is reached, Dandelion is going to offer to store items. This is the<br>only time to use storage during chapter 5. So its best to pick up everything<br>that will be needed now, such as the alp and devourer teeth for the sniffling<br>dentist. The druids in the swamp cemetary will also trade items for potions.<br>The item on the left is what they want and the item on the right is what they<br>give in return.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;white roses &gt; white honey<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;fool's parsley &gt; swallow potion<br>For gemstones they want a few different kinds for which they reward based on the<br>stone:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Diamond &gt; 3 De Vries extracts<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Amber &gt; 3 willow potions<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Ruby &gt; 3 white raffard's decoctions<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Sapphire &gt; 3 full moons<br>Finally there's women's shawls.&#xA0; Just like the precious stones, they'll reward<br>a few different things:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;A shawl &gt; 3 blizzard potions<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;red kerchief (which is actually a red shawl) &gt; 3 thunderbolts<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;gold kerchief (actually a silk shawl) &gt; 3 cat potions<br>Multiple items of the same kind can be turned in. So its possible to give 3<br>amber gems to get 9 willow potions.</p><p>As a note, if Vincent was saved during chapter 3 rather than slaughtered,<br>Dandelion will go with him. However, if Vincent was killed, Dandelion supposedly<br>gets arrested.</p><p>A good idea is to sit at the campfire and pound out some potions, bombs, and<br>blade grease while access to Dandelion is possible.&#xA0; Its best to have 2 stacks<br>of swallow, a stack of tawny owl; 2 stacks of tawny if a heavy magic user, a<br>stack of white honey to get rid of toxin's because camping isn't readily<br>available at all times like other chapters, some wolverine potions to help kill<br>faster, Samum bombs or some king and queen bombs help to alleviate the stress of<br>having multiple enemies swarming at one time, little vampire and necrophage<br>grease for the monster hunts and crypt crawls is helpful as well.&#xA0; Make some<br>willow potions or bring some amber gems to give the druids for willow potions.<br>Also make a few full moon potions and at least one golden oriole potion.&#xA0; Its a<br>lot, but it will help out in the long run later on and cut down on clutter in<br>the inventory since raws can be cut back to make more room for other items. When<br>ready, head toward the upper boardwalk to run into Zoltan.&#xA0; Once again,<br>depending on how the choices were made ealier, a new quest will open that can<br>either be "Under a Fiery Sky"-neutrality quest, "Hope Burns Bright"-scoia'tael<br>quest, or "The Flame That Cleanses"-order of the flaming rose.&#xA0; "Sweet Revenge"<br>will also start. At this point, if neutrality was chosen, Geralt is on his own.<br>If siding with the scoia'tael, good ole Zoltan is going to ride shotgun, and if<br>siding with the order, Zoltan is going to be a little upset. And it appears<br>Shani isn't too keen on the Order either.<br>&#xA0;<br>After conversing with Zoltan and potions, bombs, oils, and needed items are<br>squared away, head up to the boardwalk and fight through the enemy. This will<br>either be the nonhumans, the knights, or both.&#xA0; Work toward the Old Vizima door<br>to progress. Enemies do not stop for long during this period and more will<br>continue to come out of the doors. Scoia'tael come from the Old Vizima gate<br>while Order soldiers come from the Temple Quarter gate.</p><p>After the cutscene, Geralt will find himself in the castle speaking with<br>Foltest. After the conversation, "Her Highness the Striga" starts.</p><p>This chapter also allows for the creation of Raven's armor. The stats on it will<br>change depending on Geralt's alliance. The order version focuses more on melee,<br>the scoia'tael version focuses more on signs, and the neutral version is a happy<br>medium between the two. Regardless of play style, it is a must have item.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;+Monster Hunts+</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;BLOODWING<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Vesper is the first target. This guy is found at the cemetary with<br>the chapel in the swamp cemetary right on the path.&#xA0; He is only encountered at<br>night.&#xA0; He's really not difficult, just draw the two garkains in front of him<br>away and kill them seperately.&#xA0; This fight is really no different than a normal<br>garkain fight. Strong style silver will do quite a bit of damage to him.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Once his head is dangling from Geralt's belt, take it to the Royal<br>Huntsman that is in the druid cave for a 1000 oren reward.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;THE VAMPIRESS OF THE SWAMP<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;- Lilly is found near the chapel in the swamp cemetary as well.&#xA0; Just<br>like Vesper, she's only available at night, but there are fireplaces directly<br>at the bottom of the path to rest till nightfall.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Be sure Vesper is dead first because Lilly is found behind him.&#xA0; They<br>are very close to one another and only one trophy can be carried at a time.<br>She's actually easier than a normal bruxa, but she is surrounded by a bunch of<br>them. Pull them away one at a time or go in group style silver and massacre the<br>lot at one time. Vampire grease makes the fight stupidly easy. Once her head is<br>squared away, take it to the Royal Huntsman in the druid cave for the 1000 oren<br>reward.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-After these 2 monsters, all 10 should be dead, so get ready for a<br>nice reward.&#xA0; Its a choice of two swords: Either the silver sword Moonblade<br>that has +100 damage, or the steel sword Mahakaman Rune Sihill that has +100%<br>damage and penetrates opponent armor. This is the only possible way to get the<br>Moonblade.&#xA0; Mahakaman Rune Sihill can be obtained with other methods. Look to<br>"Mud and Velvet" and "Won't Hurt a Bit" for details on getting it. Remember,<br>Geralt can only carry 1 silver sword, so a decision needs to be made. Chances<br>are that he's using Aerondight. Moonblade has higher damage, but no detrimental<br>effects on the enemy. So decide what's more important, an increase in damage or<br>a chance to mess the enemy up in status effects.</p><p>A GAME OF DICE (Ongoing Quest)<br>-King Foltest is a dice player.&#xA0; But there is only 1 single chance to play him,<br>so save before going into his chambers in case of a loss.<br>-First word of warning, the king bets HIGH. The pot can easily reach in the<br>thousands with him if betting the maximum amount. Its fairly easy to lose<br>upwards of 3000 oren against him.<br>-Beat King Foltest and this quest finishes, leaving Geralt a dice poker legend.</p><p>A GNOMISH DEVICE (Scoia'tael Alignment Specific)<br>-This quest is only available from the dwarven armorer if running the scoia'tael<br>path.&#xA0; It is needed to create Raven's Armor.<br>-Once in swamp cemetary, follow the Quest Track to a mine with a large pulley<br>out front. Inside, follow the path till it opens up into a larger room,<br>slaying the kikimores with strong silver along the way. A few fleders may pop<br>up as well if going for the chests.&#xA0; Once done looting everything, go to the<br>wayfarer stone and use Igni, Igni, Aard to be transported to the crypt.<br>-The crypt is inhabited by mainly alps and bruxa, with a fleder or 2 and a<br>wraith.&#xA0; The item needed is in the last room on the left.<br>-Once its retrieved, head back to the wayfarer stone and hit it again with Igni,<br>Igni, Aard to get out.&#xA0; Then its back to the dwarven armorer or go acquire the<br>other items from "Armor" if they haven't been gotten yet.</p><p>A MAGIC FORMULA (Neutral Alignment Specific)<br>-This quest is only available from Kalkstein if running the neutrality path. He<br>will be the crafter of Raven's armor.<br>-Throw up the Quest Track and head out in the swamp cemetary once access is<br>possible.<br>-The piece needed for this is in the refugee cave with Cousin Ramerot for "Mud<br>and Velvet" and Zdenek for "Fistfight". Use the magic recipe Kalkstein mentioned<br>on the wayfarer's stone of Aard, Igni, Aard.&#xA0; If a mess up occurs, cast another<br>spell till Geralt says something about having to find a different combination<br>and then start fresh.&#xA0; As soon as the right combination is hit, Geralt will be<br>ported to the crypt.&#xA0; Its infested with a few basilisks, alghouls and cemetaurs.<br>-Follow the Quest Track to find the box with the item in it.&#xA0; Explore the rest<br>of the crypt for the experience and loot, though it is fairly small. After that,<br>return to wayfarer's stone and hit it with the same combination of magic that<br>got Geralt in. Then head back to Kalkstein or continue with other quests in the<br>swamp.<br>-Turn this in and he'll request the rest of the materials from "Armor" if they<br>haven't been retrieved yet.</p><p>ARMOR (Ongoing Quest)<br>-This can&#xA0; finally be completed.&#xA0; If neutral, talk to Triss and ask her about<br>armor while in the castle. She'll point her thoughts toward Kalkstein. If either<br>the order or the nonhumans were chosen, they each have an armorer that can tell<br>everything once in Old Vizima.<br>-Once free to move about Old Vizima, stop in on the person Geralt is aligned to<br>and they'll update this quest and tell what's needed and where to find it.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If nuetral,Kalkstein is the choice and he'll give "A Magic Formula".<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If scoia'teal, then the dwarven blacksmith in the makeshift forge is<br>the choice and he'll give "A Gnomish Device".<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If with the order, the choice is the order armorer in the makeshift<br>forge.&#xA0; He'll give "Saint Gregory's Litany".<br>-Regardless of which alignment, there's some exploring to do in the swamp<br>cemetary. So head over that way once updated and know exactly what's needed.<br>Quest track will lead to all the areas.<br>-First stop is Raven's crypt. Fairly easy to find along the eastern wall near<br>the old manor entrance.&#xA0; Once inside, blast the crumbled pillars aside and find<br>a trapped treasure hunter. He chatters on a bit and then runs off. Now blast<br>the other stones away and start the search.&#xA0; This crypt has fleders, wraiths,<br>and a basilisk. If taking the right path from the entrance, a meteorite sword<br>an a piece of armor (quest item) can be found. The left path leads toward the<br>main item and Raven's sarcophagus.<br>-Next stop is the chapel. Don't forget, there's also a striga in there and<br>once inside, there's no coming out till she's dead or cured.&#xA0; So if Geralt is<br>up to snuff, head on over to the chapel.&#xA0; The only monster found in this crypt<br>is Adda. Details on fighting/curing her can be found in her quest "Her Highness<br>the Striga".<br>-The part needed from this crypt is the second left straight back from the<br>entrance. Dig it out of the sarcophagus. Now head back to whoever is doing the<br>armor and get some shiny new threads with 3 belt slots and 2 dagger/torch slots.</p><p>BERENGAR'S SECRET<br>-This quest will finish during the fight with Azar.</p><p>FISTFIGHT (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Can't actually do anything with this quest until access to the swamp cemetary<br>is attained.<br>-This guy is found in the cave with Cousin Ramerot for the "Mud and Velvet"<br>quest.&#xA0; He's all the way in the back and is named Zdenek.<br>-He's really no more difficult than the others.&#xA0; Use whatever tactic has worked<br>well up till now, just know this guy has a tendency to dodge more often. After<br>beating him, he'll tell that he's actually been beaten a few times, but never<br>twice.&#xA0; So, have to go back and have another fight with him.<br>-The second time around, he gets a bit tougher.&#xA0; He even has a windup punch.<br>Beat him the second time and this quest finally comes to a close. The reward is<br>one of his teeth.&#xA0; Remember who likes teeth?&#xA0; Zdenek is the last piece in the<br>"Won't Hurt a Bit" quest.</p><p>* HER HIGHNESS THE STRIGA *<br>-This quest is started by Foltest. It seems dear old Adda has reverted to her<br>beastial ways and is enjoying a menu of refugees.<br>-Speak to Triss, Velerad and De Wett.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Triss will have a choice of chosing to tell her whether you want to be<br>with her or not if Alvin was sent with her in Chapter 3.&#xA0; Doesn't really matter<br>what is chosen.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Talk to her about armor to get an update on that if neutrality is the<br>aligned path.<br>-Discuss Adda with her, then have a dialogue with Velerad.&#xA0; He'll suggest that<br>the king wants the curse broken rather than his little girl sleeping with the<br>fishes.<br>-so, onward to De Wett to hear what he has to say which can be two different<br>things depending on alignment.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If not with the order he has very little to say, but hints at a<br>seperate reward aside from the one Foltest promised if she's killed.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If aligned with the order he'll tell about the addition reward for<br>killing Adda which is 5000 orens.&#xA0; Not bad, though Geralt will likely never<br>collect. He also mentions that Siegfried would be pleased if the king is kept<br>from disbanding the flaming rose.&#xA0; Insinuating that Geralt could call in a favor<br>after dealing with Adda.<br>-Now to have a chat with Foltest. He makes things pretty clear:&#xA0; flat out kill<br>Adda and there is neither gain nor loss, make her suffer and he'll turn Geralt's<br>world into a living hell, or finally, lift the curse and get a nice reward.<br>He'll also ask to play dice which can finish "A Game of Dice".&#xA0; Once done with<br>Foltest, talk to his Chamberlain to get a one-way trip to Old Vizima.<br>-As soon as Geralt touches down, there will be an update to search the<br>surrounding houses for Adda. Can't do that yet till after reaching the hospital.<br>-After prompted at the hospital to follow the soldier, do so and he'll lead to<br>a tower. Kill the creature there with fast style steel and afterwards Kalkstein<br>will fill in all details, updating this quest, "Sweet Revenge", and whatever<br>quest alignment has given.<br>-The next part after killing the mutant says to consult friends. This is kind<br>of tricky since there aren't many choices of people to consult. Kaulkstein has<br>some interesting things to say and he's about it.<br>-Once in the swamp cemetary, an update to find the striga near the old chapel at<br>the cemetary will come.<br>-Upon reaching the area with the chapel in the swamp cemetary, approach the<br>desperate father and he'll tell about how Adda, the striga, attacked another.<br>-Once ready, head into the chapel. There is a campfire inside, so its possible<br>to go in during the day and camp till night. Doesn't really matter what time of<br>night, so just camp till midnight for the sake of being punctual. There's a few<br>ways to go about this depending on whether the plan is to kill her or save her.<br>Regardless of which path, take a swallow to keep health up. If planning to kill<br>her, suck down a wolverine potion if available and treat the silver blade with<br>some diamond dust. If going for the knightly save, take a tawny owl so if she<br>gets out of hand, its easy to put her in place with a few blasts from Aard. She<br>has a tendency to use pain as a means of trashing chain attacks, so watch out<br>for that.<br>IMPORTANT NOTE: If cured of her striga condition, Adda will help out a bit<br>during the epilogue.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If going in for the kill, hit her with strong silver style. If she's<br>getting too many good hits in, blast her back with Aard and go in again or use<br>Quen and drink a white raffard's decoction to get some health back. Just be<br>mindful of toxcicity level.&#xA0; Pain will be the greatest problem because she'll<br>interrupt chains with it and it renders Geralt vulnerable for a few moments. <br>She has a lot of health and is immune to just about every status effect<br>including knockdown, stun, and fear. The good part is she doesn't hit too hard.<br>After killing her, head outside to talk to Velerad and claim a reward of<br>absolutely nothing. Not only is there no reward, Velerad is quite disappointed.<br>The only thing to walk away with is her heart for a potion.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now if going for the cure, focus on defense. Keep her on opposite sides<br>of the sarcophagus if possible and use Aard to push her if she's crowding. There<br>are 5 candles on her sarchophagus and day comes when the fifth one goes out,<br>which takes roughly six minutes in total.&#xA0; Each time a candle burns out, Geralt<br>and Adda will be moved to a position where she can attack more easily. Use Aard<br>and then take up position behind the sarcophagus. There's a good chance she'll<br>hit with pain at least once, but its no worry.&#xA0; She won't do enough damage to<br>kill.&#xA0; Just blow her back and take up a defensive position till the next candle<br>goes out.&#xA0; After they all burn out and she turns back to a human. Have a chat<br>with her.<br>-Whether she was saved or killed, loot her sarcophagus for Ostrit's Diary and<br>give it a read to see someone was making notes on the binding. Head outside to<br>chat with Velerad and if she was cured, recieve a brand new, very pretty steel<br>sword called D'yaebl that has +30% damage, critical effect pain +50% and<br>critical effect disarm +25%. If she was killed, get a let down speech from<br>Velerad.<br>This quest will update and freedom to explore once again is given. This quest<br>is now done till reaching the Old Manor. "Sweet Revenge" will also update.</p><p>HOPE BURNS BRIGHT (Scoia'tael Alignment Specific)<br>-Starts from Zoltan after reaching the Dike. This quest is only available if<br>siding with the scoia'tael.<br>-First is to break through the knight barricade and get to Old Vizima. Once<br>hitting the door, this quest goes on hold till out of the castle and in Old<br>Vizima.<br>-Once in Old Vizima, head to the bottom of the stairs and talk with Zoltan. He<br>wants to escort 2 groups of refuges to Shani's hospital. Pull up Quest Track to<br>find them.&#xA0; Some of the funniest dialogue comes when finding the second group.<br>Once they're in tow, head for the hospital in the center of town.&#xA0; Once inside,<br>Zoltan will give a tip on Raven's armor, saying talk to the dwarven blacksmith.<br>After a quick chat with Shani, a knight will come in and ask Geralt to help slay<br>the striga.&#xA0; Head outside and follow him to the tower where a mutant, not a<br>striga, is wreaking havoc.&#xA0; Use fast steel to cut it down, then listen to<br>Kalkstein and head back to the hospital.<br>-After a quick talk with Shani, knighs will break in. Slaughter the knights and<br>listen to Shani a bit more.&#xA0; When her dialogue finishes, head out front to kill<br>some more knights.<br>-After the knights are dead, follow Toruviel to the scoia'tael hideout.&#xA0; Once<br>inside, an elf will chatter on.&#xA0; When the opportunity arises, tell him "I must<br>speak to Toruviel".&#xA0; During the conversation with her, choose "I see"&#xA0; and then<br>"Your wish is my command" for her sex card.&#xA0; Once done with Toruviel, go outside<br>to run into Zoltan. Time to cut a path to the swamp cemetary.<br>-Follow the Quest Track which leads to right in front of the order's base and<br>slaughter the knights waiting there. Once they die, head to the right of the<br>burning buildings and up a small alley. Blow the rubish out of the way with Aard<br>and then go to the left.&#xA0; Several knights have Toruviel surrounded, so pick em<br>off.<br>-Once Toruviel is free, head up and to the right, blowing the garbage out of the<br>way with Aard.&#xA0; More knights await some steel content for thier diet.&#xA0; Many more<br>knights this time around including 2 commanders and several archers. Group style<br>tends to fail quite often, so just go with strong steel and switch between<br>targets when the need arises.<br>-After the cut-scene, Geralt will end up in the swamp cemetary with a whole<br>bunch of bloedzuigers coming. Chop em down with group silver or strong silver,<br>but remember to watch health. When they die, if too close, they'll take a chunk<br>out with their alien-like acid explosion. After all the bloedzuigers are gone,<br>the grand master will make an appearance.&#xA0; This quest comes to an end.</p><p>IDENTITY<br>-While speaking with the King in his chambers, the girl chosen during chapter 3<br>as a love interest comes up.&#xA0; Depending on the answer, there will be an equal<br>update.</p><p>MUD AND VELVET<br>-This quest starts with Antoinette in the castle. She wants some cash delivered<br>to her 3 cousins in the swamp cemetary.<br>-Each cousin is in a different cave within the swamp cemetary. Use Quest Track<br>to locate them easily.<br>-Once they've all been tracked down, head back to Old Vizima to talk to<br>Jean-Pierre.&#xA0; Kind of a big choice coming.<br>-There are two ways to turn this quest in. Telling Jean-Pierre all three<br>cousins were found nets 3 Dragon's Dream bombs.&#xA0; These are kind of dangerous<br>because after they've been dropped, they need to be ignited with Igni. The other<br>way is to tell him only two cousins were located which gets some devil's<br>puffbombs and a fight if refusing to give back the gold. The benefit of the<br>fight is he does have arguably the best steel sword in the game which is<br>Mahakaman Rune Sihill that has +100% damage and penetrates opponent armor. The<br>Sihill can be obtained other ways though. Its the reward for "Won't Hurt a Bit"<br>and can also be chosen by killing all 10 trophy monsters and talking to the<br>Royal Huntsman in the druid cave, who gives a choice between a steel or silver<br>sword.&#xA0; The steel sword from him is the Sihill sword.<br>-Anyway, if planning to fight, there's an important piece of information about<br>him.&#xA0; He has a notice board quest.&#xA0; Make sure its turned in before telling him<br>of this quest.&#xA0; Also, he hits like an atomic bomb.&#xA0; Seriously, this guy is a<br>freaking monster, so save before turn in cause there's a good chance he's going<br>to win the first round. Strong steel works best and he can be stunned, but its<br>short lived. Defeat him and claim the steel sword.</p><p>SAINT GREGORY'S LITANY (Order of the Flaming Rose Alliance Quest)<br>-This quest is only available if the order was taken as Geralt's alliance.<br>-Access to the needed chamber is through a wayfarer stone in the chapel. It<br>can be found in the very last room on the right. The letter from the armorer<br>contains a riddle in order to find the 3 spells needed to gain access. The<br>letter reads, "It is said the mob twice attacked Saint Gregory like a wailing<br>wind".&#xA0; This is Aard twice.&#xA0; Then it says "Gregory sang the litany, summoning<br>the Eternal Fire". This is Igni. So the proper combination is Aard, Aard, Igni.<br>-Once inside, there's only 1 path to take so follow it back. Strangely, there<br>shouldn't be anything but a basilisk at the very back and maybe a ghoul. Loot<br>Gregory's tomb for the prayer and then head back out to face Adda if she's<br>still a striga.<br>-Take this back to the order armorer for turn in at the earliest convenience.</p><p>SWEET REVENGE<br>-Time to hunt down Javed. The first update comes from the king in his chambers<br>while in the castle.<br>-The second update will come after dealing with Adda. It doesn't matter if<br>she's killed or cured, the same basic update is still given which is the<br>problem lies at the Old Manor.<br>-Head to the old manor through the swamp cemetary when all other quests are<br>done. There's going to be a lot of mutants, a nasty Koshchey, and Azar while<br>there. So get ready with potions or other items.<br>-Upon zoning in, De Wett will be there to roll out the welcoming mat. Guess<br>what he wants?&#xA0; Yup, he's itching to see if that white light story everyone<br>talks about is really true. Kill him and his little lackey's to update this<br>quest and "Her Highness the Striga". Switch to silver sword at this point and<br>wade through the piles of drowners, bloedzuigers and drowned dead till land is<br>reached. Switch to the steel sword and make for the path going to the right.<br>There's nothing to see or do here so go straight for the hill.<br>-Halfway up, there will be an encounter with Azar and a newly revived Mutant<br>Rayla. Yup, he put her back together again just like humpty dumpty and she can<br>be nasty. Azar will once again run off like a momma's boy with a bee sting and<br>leave Rayla to fight for him. She's quick and likes to use blind. Fast steel is<br>needed to hit her.<br>-While ascending to the top, there will be an update just before running into<br>the greater mutants. After killing the mutants, a friendly visitor shows up. If<br>neutral, Triss will come to lend a hand. If scoia'tael, Yaevinn comes to help.<br>And if aligned to the order, good old Siegfried shows up. After looting the<br>trunk and barrels, chat with the helper to learn another way in. If its Triss,<br>she'll lead to the catacombs. If its Yaevinn, he'll lead to the old well at the<br>bottom where Geralt first came out of the water. If its Seigfried, he too uses<br>an old well, but its around the back side right before where the fight with<br>Rayla took place.<br>-Regardless of how entrance is gained, it all leads to the same place eventually<br>so push forward. When a room with steel bars becomes visible, stop outside them.<br>There is going to be a nasty fight ahead with a Koschey.&#xA0; Use a white honey to<br>clear any toxins off or turn around and go to the left at the T to find a fire.<br>If Siegfriend was the helper, there's a fire right where Geralt started after<br>dropping down the well.&#xA0; Get battle ready.&#xA0; The Koschey hits hard and really<br>likes to inflict bleeding.&#xA0; So harden up with some tawny owl, swallow, wolverine<br>if possible, and a few kiss potions. If possible, touch up the silver sword with<br>diamond dust or some other damage enchancement. Aard is handy if a quick<br>breather is needed and Quen is useful if a potion is needed during the fight.<br>Try to keep attacks chained to do maximum damage as fast as possible with strong<br>silver style.<br>-Once the Koschey is dead, grab its heard, staunch any bleeding with a kiss<br>potion and move on. If lacking a willow potion, run back to the fire and make<br>one now. It will make an upcomming fight a lot easier. Once ready, move through<br>the next room. A few armored dogs need to be fought off and then hang a right,<br>or a left if Siegfried is the helper, at which point another set of bars is<br>found. This time, take a swallow, tawny owl, wolverine, and willow potion and<br>treat the steel blade with some damage augmentation. Some Greater Brothers are<br>waiting and directly after they die, Azar himself. If toxcicity is a problem,<br>clear it with a white honey and reapply all potions.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now there is a trunk, fire, and crate in this room.&#xA0; If looting them is<br>a priority, kill off one of the brothers. Then lure the other brother to the<br>front of the room near the entrance Geralt came in. Either knock the brother<br>down with Aard or stun him with some Samum bombs. Run to the back and the fight<br>should break. Once the brothers die, there is no opportunity to do anything else<br>before immediately being drawn into the fight with Azar.<br>-Fighting Azar can be difficult. He hits hard and absolutely loves to knockdown,<br>hence the willow potion. He also has a tendency to blind, but its minimal.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If Berengar wasn't killed at Black Tern Island, he's going to jump in<br>and help out.&#xA0; Seems he doesn't like Azar all that much either. This will<br>complete "Berengar's Secret". Berengar can die during the battle but whether he<br>lives or dies makes no difference.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If Berengar was killed...well...there's only one target for Azar to go<br>after.&#xA0; This will complete "Berengar's Secret".<br>-Fighting Azar can be difficult, but using Yrden can severely weaken him. As<br>stated previously, he really likes to use knockdown, so willow is a must.<br>He may also blind once or twice, but its nothing to worry about. He's immune to<br>knockdown effect and stun, so there won't be any one shot kills. Use strong<br>steel and if a combo gets interrupted, knock him down with Aard or light him<br>up with Igni and start again. The fight takes roughly 2 minutes if using the<br>rune sihill blade. Do keep an eye on where he is as well. There is the<br>possibility of actually knocking him off the platform when he dies which can<br>make retrieving his body very difficult. And in order to progress, there is a<br>quest item that must be taken from his corpse.<br>-After he's dead, walk near the mirror to get a most unexpected surprise.<br>"Witchers' Secrets" will update after the little chat with the mirror, then<br>Geralt stereotypically breaks the mirror and will pop up back outside. Talk to<br>the helper and then meet them at the docks when ready to leave. Time to go back<br>to the Temple Quarter and so ends chapter 5 and the Epilogue begins.</p><p>THE BLOEDZUIGER CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-The druids want 10 vials of bloedzuiger blood.&#xA0; Plenty roam the swamp cemetary.<br>-Once 10 vials are in hand, head over to the druid cave in the swamp cemetary.</p><p>THE BRUXA CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-The mercenary captain, Jean-Pierre, that will be standing at the entrance to<br>the swamp cemetary after Geralt has been there once, wants 6 bruxae blood. They<br>can be found in some of the crypts during the Raven's armor hunt. Also, good<br>many of them roaming near the chapel at night.<br>-Once 6 have been maimed and drained, visit Jean-Pierre in Old Vizima.</p><p>THE CEMETAUR CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Refugees in the swamp cemetary, sitting directly next to the chapel in the<br>graveyard, want 5 cemetaur jaws.&#xA0; Its their version of revenge for the cemetaurs<br>eating their friends. If neutral, during the journey to take Shani to the Swamp<br>Cemetary, many should bar the path.&#xA0; If not, they can be found in the alley next<br>to Kalkstein's place and in the crypts of the Swamp Cemetary.<br>-Once all 5 have been nabbed, head over to the chapel to deliver the jaws and<br>collect the bounty.</p><p>THE GARKAIN CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Kalkstein wants 2 saliva for who knows what.&#xA0; Once again, if neutral, some<br>can be found on the way to lead Shani to the swamp.&#xA0; If not, they're in the<br>crypts in the swamp cemetary, and near the chapel at night.<br>-Once 2 have been slain, head over to franken-Kalkstein for the reward.</p><p>THE FLAME THAT CLEANSES (Order of the Flaming Rose Allegiance Quest)<br>-First order of business is to make sure the order isn't slaughtering civilians<br>like Zoltan claims.&#xA0; So up to the boardwalk to fight through some scoia'tael.<br>-At the bottom of the stairs once reaching Old Vizima, White Rayla is waiting.<br>Turns out she caught Toruviel and did some rather unpleasant things to her. She<br>then makes a bet that Geralt can't kill more Soia'tael than her. So time to<br>collect some tails on the way to the hospital. 20 are needed which can be a bit<br>difficult to get with the scoia'tael constantly attacking. Just back off into<br>an alley till out of combat and then go after bodies. Any nonhuman that Rayla<br>fells won't have a tail on them.&#xA0; But just about any other one killed by Geralt<br>or a knight will have a tail.<br>-After getting into the hospital, Rayla will throw a fit about how Geralt<br>couldn't possibly have killed more squirrels than her and then she'll mention<br>Raven's armor and point out their armorer. Now for some great fun in getting to<br>watch Siegfried writhe a bit. when he's done whining, its Shani's turn, then<br>time to follow a knight to a striga.<br>-After dispatching the mutant, talk to Kalkstein and get updates to this quest<br>as well as "Her Highness the Striga" and "Sweet Revenge".&#xA0; Go back over to the<br>hospital for a nice little chat with Shani, during which some scoia'tael will<br>bust in. Kill them all and once able, head outside to back up Rayla.<br>-After helping Rayla out front of the hospital, she'll lead to the Order's base<br>of operations for a nice little cut scene.&#xA0; A soldier will say to<br>help with the barricade. Tell him in a minute and speak to Rayla. Choose the<br>first option as saying she means herself and then choose the option to tame her<br>another way to claim her sex card...which is rather disturbing.<br>-After meditating, go outside for a cut scene with Siegfried.&#xA0; He tells how<br>Rayla is trapped at the barricade and to take the left path to reach her. After<br>wiping out 2 groups of scoia'tael, potty mouth Rayla will show up. Continue<br>along the same path with the little knights in tow trouncing anyone in the way.<br>Once the barricade is reached, Rayla falls to an assassin's arrows.<br>-Now finally in the swamp, mop up the bloedzuegers and then its freedom to do<br>whatever for a while.&#xA0; Might want to swing around and go back to the hospital to<br>pick up the notice board quests. It would also be a good idea to visit the order<br>armorer to get some details on Raven's gear. Taking a trip by the sniffling<br>dentist to drop off teeth is another good idea so they don't accidentally get<br>used in alchemy.&#xA0; Now is also the best time to take care of all side quests and<br>monster hunts.<br>-Once everything is out of the way, head on over to the Old Manor and follow<br>"Sweet Revenge" to progress.</p><p>THE WRAITH CONTRACT<br>-Notice Board Quest<br>-Once again, Kalkstein baffles with his strange requests. This time he wants 4<br>death dusts from wraiths.&#xA0; They can be found near the chapel at night.<br>-After a few have been laid to rest, take a walk over to Kalkstein for some cash<br>and experience.</p><p>UNDER A FIERY SKY (Neutrality Quest)<br>-This is only available if neutrality was chosen in Murky Water.<br>-Zoltan says Shani is stuck at a field hospital in Old Vizima. So naturally,<br>Geralt needs to break through the fighting and pull her out.<br>-Head up the path and onto the boardwalk when ready to commence. Fight through<br>the throngs of knights and nonhumans.&#xA0; Once the door is reached, a cute little<br>cutscene shows and strangely enough, off to the castle Geralt goes.<br>-Once done in the castle and in Old Vizima, time to pick up and head toward the<br>hospital.<br>-Right after stepping onto soil from the stone wall, a nurse will approach.<br>She'll ask to be escorted to the hospital.<br>-First up, a group of scoia'teal and soldiers are going to halt progression.<br>Kill them all till this quest updates and then talk to the nurses again to get<br>them to move.&#xA0; Most often, they will just stand around after the fight unless<br>spoken to. Take them to the back entrance of the hospital where no one is<br>fighting. Once inside, a soldier will come along after some forced dialogue<br>with the nurses and Shani and say they've found Adda, updating "Her Highness the<br>Striga".&#xA0; No other option, so go deal with that immediately. Follow the soldier<br>out the door. Careful on the way out.&#xA0; Most likely will run directly into a<br>fight outside the front door.<br>-After coming to the tower, a cut scene will show with a creature, not Adda. It<br>will jump down from the tower and engage in some wetwork. Fast style steel works<br>well. After its dead, Kalkstein will explain about the nasty bugger.<br>-With the mutant dead, go back to the hospital. On the way there, stop at the<br>notice board if outside of fighting and pick up the quests. Once back inside,<br>there will be a conversation with Shani.&#xA0; Get ready though, a fight is about to<br>break out. Some scoia'tael come to cause trouble.&#xA0; Kill them all. Immediately<br>afterward they're all dead, some knights come for a lesson in learning to knock<br>before entering.<br>-Follow Shani out the back and do away with a lot of necrophages. They shouldn't<br>prove a problem though, so just truck on through the first crowd with group<br>silver and then blow the carts out of the way with Aard.<br>-Wipe out the next gaggle with group silver again and then blow the rubish<br>blocking the path away and take on some more. Once again, group silver works<br>very well.<br>-Now after the third group, there's only 1 group left. Take a moment to get any<br>health that's gone back and then carry on like the machine Geralt is. Once more,<br>a cute little cut scene commences, this time involving White Rayla and then<br>finally the swamp cemetary is open.<br>-This quest finally finishes. Kill the bloedzuiger's that are coming and after<br>they go down, get drawn into a conversation with the master of the flaming rose.<br>After that, Shani leaves for the druid caves. Turn immediately around and go<br>back to Old Vizima. There's a few things to finish. If some fun is on the<br>itinerary, go back to the hospital and head upstairs. The front door is locked<br>so enter through the back.&#xA0; Remember the nurses?&#xA0; They now have a special gift<br>waiting with Shani out of the way. Talk to them for some strange conversation<br>involving a hedgehog and then their sex card.</p><p>WITCHERS' SECRETS (Ongoing Quest)<br>-This quest will finish during the fight with Azar.</p><p>WON'T HURT A BIT (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Once the swamp cemetary is open, free reign is given, so go back to Old Vizima<br>and locate the executioners tower. It should be right near the entrance to the<br>swamp cemetary. The sniffling dentist is awaiting his teeth. Right now he<br>should have:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Beasts Fangs &gt; generic teeth found on dogs and other animals<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Barghest teeth &gt; comes from a barghest head from chapter 1 - Not<br>required so don't sweat it if he doesn't have them.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Cemetaur teeth &gt; comes from a cemetaur jaw<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Fleder teeth &gt; comes from a fleder fang<br>-Hand over the alp fangs and the devourer teeth.&#xA0; Nearly done.<br>-The last tooth needed is from Zdenek, the fistfighter!&#xA0; In order to get it,<br>"Fistfight" must be finished.&#xA0; For all of the gathering and saving and waiting,<br>the reward is the Mahakaman Rune Sihill. A steel blade with 100% damage that<br>penetrates opponent armor. Arguably the best steel blade in the game. And<br>there's only 2 other ways to obtain it, this being the easiest.</p><p>===============================================================================<br>Epilogue+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>===============================================================================<br>This chapter starts with only 3 quests, but another is picked up with the first<br>dialogue. Allegiance will dicatate who is present as well as a helper for the<br>first half. If neutral, it'll be a chat with Triss. The Order gets Siegfried,<br>and the scoia'tael will get Yaevinn. Dandelion is also present, thinking about<br>his next ballad.</p><p>FROZEN REFLECTIONS<br>-Starts once Geralt reaches the Ice Plains.<br>-Remember that white frost everyone was talking about? Here it is. This place is<br>a straight shot so run forward. Depending on who the love interest was, either<br>Triss or Shani will show up after the first encounter and explain that it isn't<br>really the white frost, but a vision conjured up inside the grand master's head.<br>Yeah, he's that crazy. She'll also tag along to give a hand during the fighting<br>ahead. Once the dialogue is over, head forward to deal with some skullheads.<br>Strong silver style works well on them.<br>-Abigail will be the second person encountered.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If she was helped in chapter 1 she'll throw some verbal abuse and<br>depeding on how she's answered, 5 tawny owls and swallows will be up for grabs.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-Now if she was left to the mercy of the villagers, she's not going to<br>be so friendly and will attack. After she dies, a half a dozen barghest will<br>show up. Kill all of them and move forward.<br>-After the encounter with her, just before entering the cave, more skullheads<br>show up.&#xA0; Once they're down, zip on in to the cave to have another chat with<br>the grand master.&#xA0; He loves hearing his own voice.<br>-Inside the cave will be some Wild Hunt Wraiths.&#xA0; At the end of the cave, if<br>neutral and gave Celina the wreath of immortelles in chapter 4, she's got a<br>little gift. Tell her its hard to act contrary to feelings and she'll give an<br>effect that restores vitality with every kill.&#xA0; Isn't she sweet?&#xA0; Now if<br>aligned with one of the factions, either Toruviel (scoia'tael) or White Rayla<br>(order of flaming rose) will help out. Also, depending on the answer given to<br>them, they may not follow but beef up Geralt's swords. Regardless of who shows<br>up, head upwards and deal with the skullheads and wraiths switching between<br>strong and quick silver styles. Yet another confrontation with the grand master.<br>And just like before, all he wants to do is talk.<br>-Now after the grand master leaves again, its mutant time. Switch up to fast<br>steel style and push forward. Halfway up the hill, some old friends are going<br>to pop up. If neutral, both Siegfried and Yaevinn along with a few knights of<br>the order are going to bar the path. If aligned with the order, Yaevinn shows<br>up with a few scoia'tael, meanwhile if aligned with Yaevinn, Siegfried is there<br>with some knights. Once they're done, move onward.<br>-After chopping down another mutant or two, Alvin shows up. He doesn't say<br>anything and just vanishes after a moment.&#xA0; Push onward some more and have<br>another conversation with the grand master.&#xA0; After a few more mutants, a bridge<br>looms ahead.&#xA0; If Adda was cured in chapter 5, she's going to lend a hand in<br>striga form no less!&#xA0; If Adda was killed, but Vincent was cured, he's going to<br>help in werewolf form!&#xA0; If both were killed, De Wett of all people shows up to<br>help out.<br>-Now after crossing the bridge there's a battle with an order commander that<br>loves to stun and some greater brothers that use knockdown.&#xA0; Drink down a full<br>moon during the fight.&#xA0; It will double health and leave vitality half filled.<br>There's a reason for this being taken now. When all the enemies are finally<br>dead, all of the helpers will part company and one last meditation session is<br>given.&#xA0; This is it, the final fight.&#xA0; The reason for drinking the full moon was<br>to allow health to completely replenish before the last fight.&#xA0; Full moon also<br>has a fairly high chunk of toxcicity attached to it, so meditating for a hour<br>clears all toxcicity and the potion will still be active due to its long running<br>duration.<br>-Once done meditating, throw on some wolverine, swallow, tawny owl, willow, coat<br>both blades in a damage augmentation and prepare for a nasty fight.<br>-The grand master is going to try to convice Geralt once more to side with him,<br>so choose whatever answer catches the eye. When that finishes, the grand master<br>is going to run off like a girl and leave the fighting to a group of mutants.<br>Group steel works very well to thin their numbers and once down to a manageable<br>state, switch up to fast and finish them off individualy. After the mutants are<br>dead, its finally a face-to-face with the grand master and a bunch of ifrits.<br>Best to swap out to fast silver to get the ifrits down. They'll become active<br>1 at a time while the grand master is still pounding away. If two or more join<br>the fray, don't bother switching to group silver. They have a high dodge rate.<br>Simply focus on one ifrit at a time using Aard to push the grand master back.<br>If focusing solely on the grand master, the ifrits will constantly break<br>chains and possibly wittle health down far enough to kill. Also, do not get<br>surrounded by the grand master and ifrits. If they are able to surround for any<br>extended amount of time, they'll drain health fast. Once all the ifrits go down,<br>if the grand master is still standing, switch out to strong steel and finish him<br>off.&#xA0; Alone, he's quite the pansy. At this point the Wild Hunt shows up.<br>-There is a choice to make after listening to the Wild Hunt. Either turn the<br>grand master over to the Wild Hunt, or don't.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If refusing to give up the grand master, the Wild Hunt must be killed.<br>For one reason or another, he's actually very easy. Use strong silver and pound<br>away at him. The hits he gives should be few and far between. The only possible<br>worry is that he summons wild hunt wraiths to help him. Ignore them if there's<br>only 1, but if he gets 2, then switch to group silver. When they're dead, go<br>back to strong style and finish him off. After that, its finally time to kill<br>the fanatical grand master.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If giving the grand master over to the Wild Hunt, Geralt still gets to<br>kill him, but the Wild Hunt gives a little teaser about who the grand master<br>really is. After the cut scene, Geralt is back at the order cloister with the<br>grand master's lifeless body lying on the ground.<br>-After the chat with Dandelion, loot the body to finish "Witchers' Secrets".<br>Go to the door Dandelion is standing at to talk with him and learn something<br>interesting.&#xA0; Then there will be a choice from Dandelion and it really doesn't<br>matter what is taken as the answer. Dandelion will give a narration of events<br>that occur afterwards depending on which path of alignment/neutrality was taken<br>and then a lovely little fmv cut-scene will play showing Geralt finally getting<br>paid the 8 thousand gold and a teaser of things to come. Congratulations, Game<br>Over.</p><p>HER HIGHNESS THE STRIGA (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Its time to tell King Foltest about either killing or saving Adda.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If she was saved, a lot of thanks come.&#xA0; There will also be a nice<br>cut-scene telling of how Witchers get more satisfaction from curing rather than<br>killing.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If she was killed, Foltest is a bit on the mean side and Radovid is<br>none to pleased either, but no dire consequences come from cutting her down<br>aside from some political strife between Foltest and Radovid.<br>-After speaking with Foltest this quest will close.</p><p>IDENTITY (Ongoing Quest)<br>-Right now there should be something concerning Triss or Shani depending on<br>which one was selected as the love interest.</p><p>THE ASHES OF VIZIMA<br>-Walk toward Foltest to have a long chat.<br>-After the talk, "Witchers' Secrets" will update along with this quest and "Her<br>Highness the Striga" will finish.<br>-The new mission is to kill the grand master. Walk over to Dandelion who will<br>store things and when ready, go past Dandelion with helper in tow. Another<br>option is presented at the corner. &#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If neutral, Siegfried is going to come along with some mutants. Chose<br>the top option about turning civilians into food and he'll attack. Choose the<br>other option and he'll let the civilians go and Geralt can pass without a fight.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If aligned with the Scoia'tael, he's going to attack.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If aligned with the order, there will be a couple knights and a greater<br>brother that must be killed.<br>-After the confrontation, head over to the Refugee and into the door to find<br>some very familiar faces. Have a seat at the fire and make a Golden Oriole. A<br>fight involving a creature that loves to poison is coming. After resting up,<br>talking to everyone, and taking care of any potion or talent needs, head<br>downstairs and loot the box for a key to the sewers and a recipe that will be<br>used very soon.<br>-Going through the door opens into another home with some wraiths and a bruxa.<br>Do away with them using group style or fast style steel and head upstairs. The<br>madman will point toward the window as the way out. Once outside, another<br>encounter awaits.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If neutral, Yaevinn will be waiting. The top option makes him attack.<br>The bottom option keeps a fight at bay and he'll even help out on the next group<br>of mutants that is coming quickly.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If aligned with the order, Yaevinn spouts a few words about Toruviel<br>and then attacks.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;-If aligned with the scoia'tael, Vizima guards will be outside to give a<br>short lived hand.<br>-After the encounter, a wounded knight will be paused upon. Go check him and get<br>a key to the sewers, then head into the door behind the pillar.<br>-Remember that Golden Oriole potion? Its going to be used in the fight with the<br>Zeugl. Go down the stairs and empty out into the sewers.&#xA0; Whoever the helper is<br>will have a few things to say.<br>-Buff up with some wolverine, swallow, tawny owl and golden oriole. Treat the<br>silver sword with some diamond dust if available. Now, in order to attack the<br>Zuegl directly, its tentacles in the middle of the room have to be killed off.<br>Once about a half dozen tentacles are cut off Zeugl will sprout his ugly head.<br>Use strong style silver for both the tentacles and his head. If there happens to<br>be three tentacles bunched together, go group style silver, but be sure to<br>switch back to strong style when his head shows. It will take about three to<br>five rounds of chopping up tenctacles before it dies. With the golden oriole<br>making Geralt immune to poison, the fight is rather simple.<br>-Once Zeugl is dead, move on toward the exit from the sewer. Stop at the<br>campfire and whip up the zeugl venom into a potion before it eludes memory.<br>There is only two or so more places to meditate before the end fight. When done,<br>take the door out.&#xA0; There's still a few greater brothers barring the path to the<br>order cloister, but nothing serious. They go down rather fast with strong steel.<br>-Once making it to the cloister doors, get ready to go at it alone. By one means<br>or another, the helper is not coming with. Head inside the cloister and talk to<br>the guards at the door. They'll of course deny entrance, so kindly stop their<br>lives short for them. Take the key from either body.&#xA0; There is a fireplace for<br>meditation if any last needs arise.&#xA0; There is only 1 more chance to meditate<br>after this one and it can only be done once and is forced.&#xA0; When ready, go<br>through the doors for a very long cut-scene.<br>-Once inside the Ice Plains, take a swallow if one isn't active and then move<br>forward for a chat with the grand master.
