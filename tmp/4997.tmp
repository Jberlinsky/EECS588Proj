Earlier this week in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, a chicken was thrown into a KFC restaurant.<p>A video posted on YouTube shows a man carry the chicken on foot to a drive-thru window while being filmed.</p><p>After waiting until the service hatch opens, he then puts the chicken inside before he and the cameraman run away.</p><p>The RSPCA noted of the incident, which reportedly forced the establishment to close temporarily: "It's just completely irresponsible to abandon an animal in this way.</p><p>"It's shocking what some find funny."</p><p>The man who carried out the deed, however, told <strong>Digital Spy</strong>: "It was just a bit of a joke.</p><p>"Obviously I'm not a dog beater or horrible to animals. It was just for a laugh."</p><p>The chicken has apparently been renamed 'Mrs Sanders' after KFC founder Colonel Sanders.</p></div></div>
