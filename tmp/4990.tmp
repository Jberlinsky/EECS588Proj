<p>Oprah Winfrey&#xA0;is the most powerful woman in the world, as dubbed by CNN and Time Magazine. Her influence is unmatched. Oprah signs up for Twitter, she gets <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oprah" target="_blank">a million followers </a>faster than anyone else. She says Mad Cow Disease has scared her off from eating red meat, the cattle industry plummets. She picks a Book Club book, it flies off the shelves.</p>
<p>Oprah is some kind of mutant super-hero with the power to make anything she touches grow beyond all logic. Oprah could show up for work on Monday and say her favorite movie was "Weekend at Bernie's 2," and by Friday women's organizations and church leagues would be gathering in discussion groups to debate the subtext of the movie.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, KFC partnered with Oprah to give away coupons for a free two-piece chicken dinner to promote their new line of grilled chicken. Response was "overwhelming," which is a polite way of saying Oprah broke KFC.</p>
<p>So many people brought the coupons in that KFC had to discontinue the program the next day because they ran out of chicken. KFC was KF'ed. The company now allows people to send in their coupons for rain checks to be used in the future, so the free food giveaways can be staggered.</p>
<p>And in spite of the public relations snafu, KFC <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090524/ap_on_bi_ge/us_kentucky_grilled_chicken_1" target="_blank">couldn't be happier</a>.</p>
<p>Even with the giveaway of coupons that weren't honored (and may never be, with the addition of a mail-away requirement), KFC says the results of being mentioned by Oprah were "transformational." The promotional value of Oprah far outweighs any blowback from not being able to fulfill the coupons in the short term.</p>
<p>Disclaimer here, the grilled chicken is pretty darn good. Without Oprah, though, not everyone would have lined up to give it a try,</p>
<p>What's interesting here is that a week before working with Oprah, KFC had an offer that would give anyone who came through the door a free piece of their grilled chicken. Giving away free chicken was fine, but giving away free chicken in connection with Oprah could break your business model completely.</p>
