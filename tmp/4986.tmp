<p>A <a href="http://dailybuzzlive.com/archives/3753">story</a> citing a University of New Hampshire study claims that the federal government forced KFC to shorten its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken when it stopped using "real chickens" and started using these tube-fed "genetically modified organisms."</p>
<p>The post, which has now been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, was published on the viral news site Daily Buzz Live, pumping new life into a rumor that has been circulating for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The rumor has been thoroughly debunked <a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/kfc.asp">by Snopes.com, which notes</a> that the company's 1991 name change had to do with menu pages and a desire to eliminate the word "fried," and nothing to do with governmental regulations.</p>
<p>But apparently, a lot of people find no reason to question the information that's making the rounds on social media:&#xA0;</p>

<p><span>"These so-called 'chickens' are kept alive by tubes inserted into their bodies to pump blood and nutrients throughout their structure," according to the completely false story. "They have no beaks, no feathers and no feet. They grow with multiple legs and wings on one 'chicken.' Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them. This is great for KFC because it saves them money for their production costs."</span></p>
<p><span>The University of New Hampshire has <a href="http://unhmagazine.unh.edu/sp00/chickensp00.html">repeatedly debunked</a> the claim that they authored a study on KFC's mutant chickens.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>"An active Internet hoax, of the urban legend type, falsely claims that KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is using genetically engineered organisms instead of chickens," according to a statement posted on the university's <a href="http://www.unh.edu/BoilerPlate/kfc.html">website</a>. "The hoax includes reference to an unspecified study of KFC done at the University of New Hampshire and there is no such research or study that was done here."</span></p>
<p><span>We've reached out to KFC for comment on the hoax and will update when we hear back.</span></p>
