        <p>A HOST of new Australian acts is helping fuel a music industry
recovery, the latest ARIA wholesale figures show. The 16-year-old
singer-songwriter <b>Gabriella Cilmi</b>, along with the pop-rock
groups <b>Gyroscope</b>, <b>Cut Copy</b> and the <b>Presets</b>,
were among the local acts to reach No. 1 on the charts, joining
established names such as <b>Kasey Chambers</b> and <b>Pete
Murray</b>, with Australian music accounting for about a third of
chart-making acts.</p>

        <p>The six-month figures to June, released by the Australian
Recording Industry Association, show CD sales are still falling,
with an 8.5 per cent drop in CD albums, although they are still
outselling digital albums, and a 50 per cent drop for CD
singles.</p>

                    
        <p>Digital music is skyrocketing, with a 50 per cent increase in
album and single sales, fuelled by the release of digital-only
singles, including <i>Don't Stop The Music</i> by the US R&amp;B
singer <b>Rihanna</b>, the first digital-only to make No. 1.</p>

        <p>Music lovers bought more than 12 million digital singles in the
six months, up from almost 8 million last year, compared with
640,000 physical singles. As yet they still prefer to buy CD
albums, with more than 17.6 million sold, compared with 383,245
digital albums. Sales for the even more retro format of vinyl also
grew, as did music DVD sales, thanks in part to nursing-home pin-up
boy <b>Andre Rieu</b>.</p>

        <p>While the figures show a 4 per cent drop in overall revenue
compared with the same period last year, ARIA's chairman, <b>Ed St
John</b>, said the growth of digital was a positive sign for the
music industry.</p>

        <p>"This is a considerably shallower decline than we've seen in
recent years," he said. "This is only the beginning of a whole new
cycle for the Australian music business."</p>

        <h2><b>ALL TOO CUTE</b></h2>
<br>

These days aspiring designers need more than a pretty frock to get
a break. Tonight and this weekend at the Emerging Designers Market
at the Fringe Bar in Paddington, part of the Sydney Fashion
Festival, new labels are pulling out all stops, from the cute idea
of sisters <b>Kash</b> and <b>Clare O'Hara</b> of selling matching
ties and cufflinks, to another label's cute name, <b>Spunky
Bruiser</b>. While the name is a play on the 1980s sitcom star
Punky Brewster, the label has a post-millennium take on fashion,
using pre-loved fabrics to create new items, such as "tracky-jeans"
- jeans cut off at the knee, with tracksuit attached. Cute. 

        <h2><b>ALLEGRO RUN</b></h2>
<br>

The cellist <b>Steven Isserlis</b> got the call every musician
dreads in his Sydney hotel on Wednesday night. The one that begins:
"You do remember the concert starts early tonight, don't you?" Erm.
Well. That left the British musician and children's book author
just 40 minutes to dash from the hotel to the City Recital Hall
stage for his final performance with the Australian Chamber
Orchestra. There was no time to warm up, just time to get down the
hotel's 26 floors - stopping all stations. 

        <p>He explained his rising angst to passengers in the lift,
prompting one man to helpfully suggest that Isserlis tell people he
had been delayed because he had been mugged en route.</p>

        <p>Out on the street, Isserlis hailed a cab and asked for the City
Recital Hall. "Where?" replied the cabbie. None of which does much
for one's inner calm, he told the audience, before playing with
great aplomb.</p>

        <h2><b>BIRTHDAY SLEEP</b></h2>
<br>

NOVA breakfast radio's new kid on the block, <b>Kate Ritchie</b>,
who turned 30 yesterday, celebrated her birthday with a little
sleep-in. When the former <i>Home And Away</i> star didn't turn up
for the 6am start, her co-hosts, <b>Tim Ross</b> and <b>Merrick
Watts</b>, contacted Ritchie, who was in her car on the way to the
studio. She arrived half an hour late. Her excuse? A sober night
out at the <i>Dolly</i> Teen Choice Awards. 

        <p>And in other sobering news, the chicken-loving former
<i>Playboy</i> centrefold <b>Pamela Anderson</b> will return to our
shores this month to introduce her new <i>E!</i> show, <i>Pam: Girl
On The Loose</i>. It will feature footage from her recent trip to
Australia, when she entered the <i>Big Brother</i> house and tried
to demonise KFC.</p>

        <h2><b>WORDSMITHS' TURN</b></h2>
<br>

The brains behind the brawn will get their time in the limelight at
the Australian Writers' Guild awards in Melbourne tonight. Usually
happy to be upstaged by the actors and actresses who portray their
characters, the writers will vie for AWGIEs in categories including
best short film, best television series and best original
telemovie. In the feature film category, the nominees are <b>Shayne
Armstrong</b> with <b>Jon Hewitt</b> and <b>Shane Krause</b> for
<i>Acolytes</i>, <b>Elissa Down</b> and <b>Jimmy the Exploder</b>
for <i>The Black Balloon</i>, <b>Jonathan Ogilvie</b> for <i>The
Tender Hook</i> and <b>Jasmine Yuen-Carrucan</b> for <i>Cactus</i>.


        <h2><b>FASHION POLICE Shoe addicts</b></h2>
<br>

IF CLOTHES maketh the man, shoes must come close to making the
woman. Manolo Blahnik was so prevalent in <i>Sex And The City</i>
he might as well have pulled up a chair at the bar and listened to
tales of Samantha's latest bedroom antics. So revered is the
footwear legend Christian Louboutin that fashionista fork out small
fortunes to score that coveted flash of his signature red sole. 

        <p>The Powerhouse Museum is offering a fix for shoe addicts - one
that won't leave a nasty dent in the budget. As part of the Sydney
Design 08 festival, the assistant curator of design history and
society, Rebecca Bower, will conduct tours through the bowels of
the museum, showing off its footwear collection.</p>

        <p>The eclectic mix includes a Chinese bound-foot shoe, a blue
mock-croc platform shoe like the ones Naomi Campbell was wearing
when she tumbled off the catwalk and a chunky rhinestone-encrusted
clodhopper.</p>

        <p>And Bower's favourite? A black leather barrette boot from 1896
from the collection of the London shoemaker Joseph Box. "It speaks
to the fetishist in me," she said.</p>

        <p>Tours are on Monday from 2pm to 3pm and August 23 from 11am to
noon, $16 or $10 concession.</p>
