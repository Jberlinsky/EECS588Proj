		<p><b>Less of the rock star</b></p>
<p>Pete Murray has come a long way since playing to four people at the Muse Bar 
in East St Kilda in 2001. Sitting at number 2 on the charts this week behind the 
John Butler Trio, he is in the middle of a national tour, including sold out 
shows at the Forum on Saturday and Monday. He told <em>Sticky</em> he was still 
coming to terms with his success and fame.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to be a rock star, this is a business for me. I want to 
create a lifestyle so I can make a living out of it. I don't particularly like 
my face being plastered in papers and on TV, that's really uncomfortable for me. 
Some people love it and they do it for that reason."</p>
<p>His new legion of fans appear to relate to his emotive voice and sad songs, 
many of which were written during and about the hard times before his success. 
With his partner recently giving birth and his career taking off, some of the 
new songs he has written for the next album are understandably a bit brighter. 
But he doesn't want to fix what is not broken. "You don't want to lose what 
you've already got. It's important that people can connect to my lyrics but with 
a bit more light in there and less heavy shade."<islandad>

<p><strong>Down Under in Texas</strong></p>
<p>We all wish we could be in Texas today, where some of Australia's brightest 
stars will be performing at the Australian Music Showcase &amp; Barbecue at Emos 
Annex at the South By Southwest Music Festival &amp; Conference. Ground 
Components, End Of Fashion, Shane Nicholson, Riff Random, Gelbison, Powderfinger 
and John Butler Trio are some of the 1060 acts vying for the attention of the 
world's music professionals. But End of Fashion will be doing it with 
Silverchair's Ben Gillies in tow, after their drummer, Michael Hobbs, failed to 
apply for his visa on time.</p>
