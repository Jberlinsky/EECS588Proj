  Boy, it just goes to show that maybe you can't judge a performance by a movie's trailer. Leonardo DiCaprio just copped a Best Supporting Actor nominee for his role in "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/django-unchained/">Django Unchained</a>." Since "Django Unchained" is nominated for Best Picture in the Drama category, one can only assume that the nomination for DiCaprio is intended to reflect the fact that the intention of his performance is to create drama.
</p>
<p>
  I could get if the nomination were specifically for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy. Having lived all my life in the South, I recognize a comedic attempt at a southern accent when I hear it. Having been eating KFC not only from back when it was known as Kentucky Fried Chicken but when the chicken from that restaurant always came in a bucket when you ordered enough for an entire family, I recognize someone who has learned his southern accent from watching vintage footage of Col. Sanders. That DiCaprio is playing a character whose voice is based on Col. Sanders goes without saying.
</p>
<p>
  What does not go without saying is how that translates into a dramatic performance, much less one that is deserving of even a Golden Globe nomination.
</p>
<p>
  Then again, as previously indicated, perhaps a movie's trailers or selected film clips chosen to be aired out of context are not the ideal method for determining the full complexity of a performance that runs throughout a film. A trailer and even film clips must be taken on their own, one supposes, rather than utilized for extrapolation of the movie as a whole. Anyone who saw the original trailer for "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/the-dark-knight/">The Dark Knight</a>" and was overcome with the nausea that accompanies the suspicion that you have just witnessed yet another in a line of empty-headed action movies would have learned this lesson.
</p>
<p>
  And yet, there is something to be said for the experience of watching Leonardo DiCaprio playing a sinister Col. Sanders and engaging in extrapolation. Perhaps the Foreign Press Association is onto something. Perhaps they know better than one who has spent a lifetime among natives of Dixie who have never, not even once, heard that particular accent anywhere but in movies when spoken by actors not raised there. Maybe, just maybe, the nomination of Leonard DiCaprio for Best Supporting Actor indicates that Hollywood Foreign Press Association recognized an element contained within the entirety of DiCaprio's performance that transcends what has thus far been exhibited in truncated footage.
</p>
<p>
  Or, perhaps the ghost of Pia Zadora is rising to extract some Django-style revenge.
