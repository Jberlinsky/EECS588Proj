<p>The Xbox One will use real names, eventually. It has been made clear that the Xbox One won&#x2019;t be switching over to real names at launch but instead will keep using the Gamertags that everybody knows.This has been confirmed by a representative from Microsoft.</p>
<p><em>&#x201C;While real identities continue to be part of out plans for the experience on the Xbox One, at launch, customers will continue to search for friends using their Gamertags.&#x201D;</em></p>
<p>This is all fine and dandy, to tell the truth I do not want the people that are on Xbox Live to see my real name. It also won&#x2019;t be a problem for us because unlike the 13 countries listed on the Xbox site that will have the console launch next month, we South African will have the luxury of seeing this from the outside. Then again having to not guess whether someone is really who they say they are might just be an upside; that is if the real names that have been given are accurate.</p>
<p>Just to clarify at launch the Xbox One will still use the Gamertag system but eventually the Gamertags will be replaced by the persons real name and everyone that views their profile will be able to see their name. Kind of just like Facebook.&#xA0;</p>
