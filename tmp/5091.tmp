                <p>A funny email I got a while back that made me chuckle. The stuff in parentheses are my own comments <img src="http://dingo.care2.com/c2c/emoticons//sardonic.gif" border="0"></p><p>I just want to thank all of&#xA0;you for your educational e-mails over&#xA0;the past year. I am totally screwed up&#xA0;now and have little chance of recovery.</p><p>I no longer open a public&#xA0;bathroom door without using a paper towel. (Just make sure to remove the towel! Leaving it there all wet is a breeding ground for bacteria!)</p><p>Or have them put lemon&#xA0;slices in my ice water without worrying about the bacteria on the lemon&#xA0;peel.</p><p>I can't use the remote in a hotel room because I don't&#xA0;know what&#xA0;the last person was doing while flipping through adult&#xA0;movie&#xA0;channels. Nor can I sit on the hotel bed spread because I can only&#xA0;imagine what has happened on it since it was last washed.</p><p>I have&#xA0;trouble shaking hands with someone who has been driving because the #1 pasttime while driving alone is picking one's nose.</p><p>Eating a little&#xA0;snack sends me on a guilt trip because I can only imagine how many gallons of Trans fats I have consumed over the&#xA0;years.</p><p>I can't touch any woman's&#xA0;purse for fear she has placed it on&#xA0;the floor of a public bathroom.</p><p>I&#xA0;must send my special thanks to whoever sent me the one about poop in the glue&#xA0;on&#xA0;envelopes because I now have to use a wet sponge with every envelope that&#xA0;needs sealing. (I hate the taste of the glue, so I use the kind that's self-adhesive!)</p><p>Also, now I have to scrub the top of every can I&#xA0;open&#xA0;for the same reason. (A good idea, actually)</p><p>I no longer have any savings because I gave it to a sick girl (Penny Brown) who's about to die in the hospital for the&#xA0;1,387,258th time.</p><p>I no longer have any money at all, but that will change once I receive the $15,000 that Bill Gates/Microsoft and AOL are&#xA0;sending me for participating in their special e-mail program.</p><p>I no longer worry about my soul because I have 363,214 angels looking out for me, and St. Theresa's novena has granted my every wish. (Uh-hmm, sure)</p><p>I no longer eat KFC&#xA0;because their chickens are actually&#xA0;horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or&#xA0;feathers. (Ahem, I'm transitioning to full veganism. Besides, FOOD ALLERGIES! And they don't tell you what's in their seasoning)</p><p>I won't touch margarine, as it is just one molecule away from&#xA0;being plastic.</p><p>I no longer use cancer-causing deodorants even though&#xA0;I&#xA0;smell like a water buffalo on a hot day.</p><p>Thanks to you, I have learned&#xA0;that my prayers only get answered if I&#xA0;forward an e-mail to seven of my&#xA0;friends and make a wish within five minutes.</p><p>Because of your concern I&#xA0;no longer drink Coca Cola because it&#xA0;can remove toilet stains, nor do I drink&#xA0;Pepsi or Dr. Pepper since the people&#xA0;who make these products are atheists who&#xA0;refuse to put 'Under God' on their&#xA0;cans. (Pfft! I want freedom from religion!</p><p>I can no longer buy gasoline&#xA0;without taking someone along to watch&#xA0;the car so a serial killer won't crawl&#xA0;in my back seat when I'm pumping gas.</p><p>I no longer use Saran wrap in the&#xA0;microwave because it causes&#xA0;cancer. (Well, plastic can leach toxins, er, certain grades/types)</p><p>And thanks for letting me know I&#xA0;can't boil a cup of water in the&#xA0;microwave anymore because it will blow up in&#xA0;my face, disfiguring me for&#xA0;life. (Only possible with containers with narrow openings, ie long necked bottles)</p><p>I no longer check the coin return on&#xA0;pay phones because I could be&#xA0;pricked with a needle infected with&#xA0;AIDS.</p><p>Neither will I go to shopping malls because someone&#xA0;will drug me&#xA0;with a perfume sample and rob me.</p><p>I no longer receive packages from UPS&#xA0;or Fed Ex since they are actually&#xA0;Al Qaeda in disguise. (Ha!)</p><p>I won't shop at&#xA0;Target since they are French and don't support our American troops or the Salvation Army. (Ha! again)</p><p>I no longer answer the phone because someone will&#xA0;ask&#xA0;me to dial a number for which I will get a phone bill with calls to Jamaica, Uganda, Singapore, and&#xA0;Uzbekistan. (You shouldn't dial what a stranger asks you to anyway, as this is a possibility, at least with multi-line phones like they have in offices)</p><p>I no longer buy&#xA0;expensive cookies from Neiman Marcus since I now have their recipe.</p><p>Thanks to you, I can't use anyone's toilet but my own because a&#xA0;big brown African spider is lurking under the seat to cause me&#xA0;instant death when it bites my butt. (Even if there's no spider, you should look down before sitting down; at least you'll be sure that the seat's down and clean!)</p><p>And thanks to your great advice, I can't ever&#xA0;pick up $5.00 dropped in the parking lot because it probably was placed there&#xA0;by a sex molester waiting underneath my car to grab my leg.</p><p>I can't do&#xA0;any gardening because I'm afraid I'll get bitten by the brown recluse and my&#xA0;hand will fall off.</p><p>If you&#xA0;don't send this e-mail to at least 14,000 people in the next 14 minutes, a large dove with diarrhoea will land on your head at 5:00 PM tomorrow afternoon&#xA0;and the fleas from 1,000 camels will infest your back, causing you to grow a&#xA0;hairy hump. I know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of&#xA0;my next door neighbour's ex-mother-in-law's second husband's cousin's beautician . . .</p><p>Have a wonderful day . . .</p>
