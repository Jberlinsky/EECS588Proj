      <div class="fin_story_body"><p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) &#x2014; Princess Irina Walker, daughter of the last king of Romania, has pleaded not guilty to operating a cockfighting business with her husband at their Oregon ranch.<br>
<br>
She entered the plea at a hearing on Friday.<br>
<br>
Government prosecutors warned that Walker is a flight risk because she was born in Switzerland and could be granted asylum in that country.<br>
<br>
Judge John V. Acosta ordered her to surrender her passport and told her not to leave her home county, except to go to nearby Hermiston for groceries and doctor appointments.<br>
<br>
A total of 18 people have been charged in the case.<br>
<br>
Walker's daughter, Angelica Kreuger, says her mother loves animals and would never watch a chicken die in a fight.<br>
