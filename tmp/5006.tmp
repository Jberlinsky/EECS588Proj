    <p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/topic/britney-spears" class="inline_link">Britney Spears</a> grabbed a bag of <a href="http://www.examiner.com/topic/kfc" class="inline_link">KFC</a> on her way home from a Shape magazine cover shoot. What&#x2019;s a busy mom to do? She spent a hard-working morning on a photo shoot for a fitness magazine, and then she stopped off and picked up a bucket of calories for Tuesday&#x2019;s lunch, reports <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2296013/Britney-Spears-shoots-cover-fitness-magazine-Shape--celebrates-fried-chicken-treat.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daily Mail</a> on Wednesday, March 20.</p>
<p>Or was it dinner? And don&#x2019;t count out the fact that the chicken could have been grilled. But KFC is more the place to lay in a comfort-food meal than to plan a fitness campaign.</p>
<p>Apparently Beyonce did the same thing, after shooting her Shape cover &#x2013; the one on the current issue. What&#x2019;s it about doing a photo shoot for the fitness mag that makes celebrities want to tuck into fried chicken?  It&#x2019;s a good bet Jillian Michaels did not fall into this pattern.</p>
<p>Anyway, Britney Spears failed to mention the KFC when she <a href="https://twitter.com/britneyspears/status/313908591130189824" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> her adventures to all her friends and fans. &#x201C;@Shape_Magazine Thanks for the great photo shoot today! It was fun to get all dolled up for the cover!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The dolled-up part did not last, as Britney left in cut-offs and a pretty white tee. She paired it all with flip-flops and a messy ponytail. And even later in the day, Brit went out for coffee in sweats and a baggy top, with fuzzy boots. Comfort ruled. After all, Brit had spent a really busy day.</p>
