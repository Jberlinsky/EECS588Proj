<p>Based on the hit series of YA novels of the same name, the show &#x2018;Sweet Valley High&#x2019; starred real-life twins Brittany and Cynthia Daniel as popular sisters Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield. Almost 20 years after the show&#x2019;s debut, we check in with the Daniel sisters to see what they&#x2019;ve been up to.</p>

<p><strong>Then:</strong></p>
<p>Brittany and Cynthia Daniel were widely known as the Doublemint twins for starring in the chewing gum company&#x2019;s commercials before landing their very own TV series with &#x2018;Sweet Valley High.&#x2019; Based on the characters created by Francine Pascal in her classic series of young adult books, the show followed identical-looking (but not identical-acting) twins Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield as they navigated life in high school. </p>
<p>The twins also starred on &#x2018;The New Leave it to Beaver&#x2019; series and made their film debut in the 1996 drama &#x2018;The Basketball Diaries&#x2019; with Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>

<p>Cynthia retired from acting after &#x2018;Sweet Valley High,&#x2019; returning only once in 2002 for an appearance in the short-lived series &#x2018;That &#x2019;80s Show,&#x2019; in an episode that featured her sister. Cynthia is now a photographer and is married to actor Cole Hauser; the pair have two children.</p>
<p>Brittany continues to act, and has appeared in films like &#x2018;Joe Dirt&#x2019; and &#x2018;Skyline&#x2019; (the above photo was taken at the &#x2018;Skyline&#x2019; premiere &#x2014; Brittany is on the right). She had a starring role on &#x2018;That &#x2019;80s Show,&#x2019; and on the series &#x2018;The Game,&#x2019; which ended in 2011.</p>
