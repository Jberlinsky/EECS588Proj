<blockquote><p>They are big. A pound or a pound and a half. Rats! Plump, healthy-looking and oh-so-agile.</p>
<p><strong>CBS 2 cameras caught dozens of them early Friday morning through the window of this closed KFC-Taco Bell in the West Village.</strong></p>
<p>And now CBS 2 has learned that the Department of Health will keep the restaurant closed until it can reinspect it. </p></blockquote>
<p> We&#x2019;re sorry but when news crews and neighbors can see huge, <em>huge</em> rats running around in your restaurant through the window&#x2026; you had to have known. The reporter is literally standing there LIVE going &#x201C;Look, rats!&#x201D; and the camera guy films the rats. Not exactly a stake-out. The KFC Taco Bell is at 6th Ave and West 4th Street in NYC.<small>&#x2014;MEGHANN MARCO</small></p>
