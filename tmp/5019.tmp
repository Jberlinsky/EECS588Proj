<p><a href="http://www.ecorazzi.com/2008/02/13/british-supermarket-tesco-doubles-order-for-free-range-chickens/" target="_self">Taking a page out of <strong>Jamie Oliver&#x2019;s</strong> book</a>, <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> will today at 4pm EST go behind the scenes of the poultry industry and contrast the practices there with organic, free-range chicken farming. Her almost 10 million viewers are about to receive one hell of an education!</p>
<p>Oprah&#x2019;s investigative reporter Lisa Ling will show people how we treat the animals we eat. <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2008/10/tivo_alert_oprah_and_the_omniv.php" target="_blank">According to SFoodie</a>, based on the teaser, &#x201C;farmers (and farming practices, including egg production) will be put on the hot seat.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/14/11402/471" target="_blank">Grist also weighs in on the huge response</a> Oprah&#x2019;s special may create saying, &#x201C;The talk-show queen&#x2019;s opinions move mountains; people have been wondering for years when she would train serious attention on the food system. Today&#x2019;s show reportedly focuses on animal welfare, discussing California&#x2019;s Prop. 2, which would improve some of the more egregious conditions faced by factory-raised chickens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Truly, this is fantastic news &#x2014; especially since we&#x2019;ve been <a href="http://www.ecorazzi.com/2007/12/20/the-green-picture-uks-top-chefs-pull-back-curtain-on-chicken-farms/" target="_self">so envious of the UK&#x2019;s work in this area</a>, while frustrated with the little education available to the mainstream public here in the U.S.</p>
<p>But enough babble &#x2014; go watch! Now!</p>
