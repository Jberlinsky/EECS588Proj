<div class="entry-content"><p>Thank god for small favors, &#x201C;KFC&#x201D; is back to Kentucky Fried Chicken after over a decade of trying to make us forget the &#x201C;fried&#x201D; part. Or, come to think of it,  maybe it was the &#x201C;Kentucky&#x201D; they were worried about. Anyway, it&#x2019;s back, and the Colonel himself has undergone a bit of a redesign. He now sports an apron, which is a nice touch. </p>
<p>Also, to celebrate, Kentucky Fried Chicken is marketing to extraterrestrials by becoming the the world&#x2019;s first brand visible from space.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If there are extraterrestrials in outer space, KFC wants to become their restaurant of choice,&#x201D; KFC President Gregg Dedrick said in a statement.</p>
