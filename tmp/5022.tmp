In his routine, he would often refer to the bowls as a "failure pile in a sadness bowl." Although the bit of stand-up even found its way onto <a href="http://buzzsugar.com/tag/Late+Night+with+Conan+O%27Brien" rel="nofollow">Late Night With Conan O'Brien</a>, it turns out that it was all just for show; Oswalt had never actually tasted one of the famous bowls. </p>

<img src="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl0/1/15259/02_2008/kfcbowl.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image outline left preview" width="260"></span>To make things right, <b>The Onion</b>'s A.V. Club asked him to <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/a_v_club_taste_test_special_the" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taste test one</a>. I was expecting the article to become a, "What do you know? They're not that bad after all!" sort of an article, but it didn't. In the end Oswalt can now rightfully hate on the Famous Bowl. In fact he sums it all up into one delicate sentence, "It's goddamn horrible, this Famous Bowl."</p>
<p>So what do you think? Do you agree with him &#x2014; you should read the whole piece it's pretty fun &#x2014; or do you think he's full of it?</p>
