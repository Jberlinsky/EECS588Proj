<p>Somewhere an anonymous video editor IS PISSED. He&#x2019;s spent all night mashing together a local KFC commercial with <a href="http://www.uproxx.com/webculture/2014/04/game-lulz-game-of-thrones-season-4/" target="_blank">The Hound&#x2019;s love for chickens</a> because most obvious video ever, and now <a href="http://www.uproxx.com/topic/jimmy-kimmel" target="_blank">Jimmy Kimmel</a> has beat him to the punch. It&#x2019;s probably the same dude Kimmel jumped through the television to berate a the Oscars.</p>
<p>So yeah, in conclusion this is pretty much exactly what you&#x2019;d expect it be. Needs more Hound c-bombs and Lommy questions, but still made fairly great thanks to &#x201C;Every f*cking chicken in this room.&#x201D;</p>
