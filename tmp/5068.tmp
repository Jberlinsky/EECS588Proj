<p>What do you go for when drunk and where? Also, have you eaten anything that you would not have eaten while sober?. I mean morning after Pizza or something along those lines <img src="http://www.cubed3.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smilie"></p>
<p>I go for the Lamb shish in a homemade pitta myself. Kebab houses that serve a Kebabs in those pre made pitta\'s are crap!, that bread has no taste at all. If you taste a home made one cooked in a clay oven it taste far far better. </p>
<p>I had a lunchtime drink and am scoffing one now.</p>
<p>It seems Kebab eating has become a tradition in British drinking culture now, when it once used to be plain ol chips. The phrase cheap as chips does not really count now I think, fish n chips is actually quite expensive, where I live anyway. </p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I wonder if other countries have their own foods that they eat when drunk, in a traditional sort of way. The only one that comes to my mind is Taco\'s in the US, but I\'m sure there must be others.</p>
