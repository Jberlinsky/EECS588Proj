	    <p>A teenage boy found found a chicken piece from&#xA0;KFC&#xA0;that looked like a brain in his meal.&#xA0;Ibrahim&#xA0;Langoo&#xA0;took a picture of his food and complained to the&#xA0;Colchester, Essex branch&#xA0;along with his friend &#xA0;Laura Canning.<br></p>
<p>According to&#xA0;The Daily Mail, the&#xA0;musical theatre students went for a bite to eat when they were shocked of their findings, "The first piece was absolutely fine - I was hungry and polished it off,"&#xA0;Langoo&#xA0;said. "I have a habit of picking the chicken off the bone with my fingers, and as I pulled the second piece apart I saw this horrible wrinkled foreign body.&#xA0;I threw it down onto my tray immediately. It looked like a brain.&#xA0;I suddenly felt grim and really sick.&#xA0;I couldn't bring myself to pick the lump up so I went to the serving counter to complain.&#xA0;It was about 1pm and pretty hectic in the restaurant and as it was so busy none of the staff helped me."<br></p><p>Like Us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MstarsNews" target="_blank">Facebook</a> </p>
<p>Langoo&#xA0;was still upset with their customer service and her decided to go to corporate to complain and posted the picture he took with his phone and posted the images online. "I didn't want to pick the "brain" up as I couldn't bear to look at it,' Mr&#xA0;Langoo&#xA0;said. 'I was grossed out by the fact that I could so easily have eaten it without realizing.&#xA0;I just wanted to get out of&#xA0;KFC&#xA0;as quickly as I could. I still feel really sick and disgusted by it all now.&#xA0;KFC&#xA0;say they are sorry and are concerned to hear of my experience as they have "rigorous standards" but I'm still not impressed.&#xA0;I never want to eat&#xA0;KFC&#xA0;again - in&#xA0;Colchester&#xA0;or anywhere else. I'll eat chicken at home, where I can see how it's been prepared."<br></p>
<p>When experts examined the picture, they believed it to be a chicken's kidney. A&#xA0;KFC&#xA0;spokesman confirmed the image as a kidney and released a statement saying:<br></p>
<p>"We always try to ensure the highest standards in all of our restaurants.&#xA0;Although we haven't received the product, it appears from a photograph that unfortunately on this occasion a kidney, and not a brain as claimed, was not removed in the preparation process.&#xA0;We're very sorry about Mr Langoo's experience and while there was no health risk, we agree it was unsightly.&#xA0;We will be carrying out a full investigation and providing him with a gesture of goodwill."<br></p>    <small>&#xA9; 2014 Mstars News, All rights reserved.
