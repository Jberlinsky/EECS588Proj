<p>Back in 2004, he brought us lots of laughs as the nerdy, mouth-breathing &#x2018;Napoleon Dynamite,&#x2019; but what&#x2019;s Jon Heder been up to since then?</p>

<p><strong>Then:&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p>GOSH! Jon Heder made his big screen debut as the titular character in the quirky &#x2018;Napoleon Dynamite,&#x2019; playing a guy we could all kind of relate to: annoyed with his brother, trying to connect with girls, and getting on his grandma&#x2019;s dang nerves. Napoleon instantly became an iconic character, and we all just wanted more of the hilarious actor behind the afro and glasses.</p>

<p>Heder quickly launched to fame, using his unconventional looks and demeanor to his advantage and landing roles in &#x2018;Blades of Glory,&#x2019; &#x2018;The Benchwarmers&#x2019; and &#x2018;School for Scoundrels.&#x2019; In recent years, he&#x2019;s starred in the films like &#x2018;For Ellen&#x2019; and &#x2018;When in Rome.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Heder has a twin brother named Dan, and is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The actor learned Japanese to go on an LDS mission to Japan and, thanks to growing up as an Eagle Scout, Heder is now a Scoutmaster for his very own troop. He married his wife, Kirsten, in 2002, and the pair have two kids together.</p>
