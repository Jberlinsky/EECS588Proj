										<p>Here are my five favorites of the Top 25 hottest urban legends circulating on the Internet, as determined by the myth busters at the urban legend website <a href="http://snopes.com/info/top25uls.asp">Snopes.com.</a></p><p>&#x2022; "As of 20 March 2014, Facebook will be banning all posts expressing religious beliefs."</p><p>&#x2022; "The government forced KFC to stop using the word 'chicken' because they serve meat from mutant animals."</p>

								<p>&#x2022; "A dog named Daisy rescued hundreds of people from the damaged World Trade Center towers on <a class="taxInlineTagLink" id="EVHST000001" title="September 11, 2001 Attacks" href="http://www.mcall.com/topic/unrest-conflicts-war/terrorism/september-11-2001-attacks-EVHST000001.topic">9/11</a>."</p><p>&#x2022; "Photograph shows a deadly snow snake." ("It has bitten 3 people in the state of Ohio and one in Pennsylvania &#x2026; It comes out in the cold weather and at this time there is no cure for it's bite. One bite and your blood starts to freeze. Scientist are trying to find a cure. Your body temperature start to fall once bitten &#x2026; Please forward this and try to save as many people as we can from this deadly snow snake.")</p><p>I was among the recipients of that Obama claim, and I guarantee there are people out there who believe it. I routinely respond to forwarded emails such as these by directing the sender and sometimes everyone on the list to an article in Snopes or elsewhere that explains it's fake, which this was.</p><p>Fact is, some people will believe almost anything, if it sounds authoritative enough. So I suppose there will be handful of gullible rubes who will believe the following ineptly written/punctuated/spelled email &#x2014; actually, it reads very much like that snow snake warning, which I hope is a coincidence &#x2014; sent out Wednesday afternoon by Kim Plyer of the public relations firm Sahl Communications.</p><p>"<i>In a meeting held Monday March 31, 2014 Northampton County Executive John Brown, informed Sahl Communications, Inc that he will be pulling the company's public relations contract with the county. After having had a meeting with his legal team and advisors the decision was made on the best interest for the county.</i></p><p><i>"We came to this conclusion prior to learning about Mr. [Controller Steve] Baron's [sic] decision to file suit," said Brown. "I met with Mr. Barron on Monday morning and told him I would respond back to him after considering his request."</i></p><p><i>"After decisions with legal council and the contractor, Sahl Communications, I decided it was in the best interest of the county to withdraw the agreement."</i></p><p>I'll quickly review by explaining that Brown has begun his first &#x2014; and, if he keeps this up, almost certainly last &#x2014; term by trying to hire a bunch of consultants without bidding or competitive negotiations. Many people, <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/local/white/mc-bw-northampton-county-20140310%2C0%2C4031204.column">including me,</a> have pointed out that this is fiscally irresponsible, and some have argued it's illegal under the county's administrative code.</p><p>The legal issue turns on whether a public relations consultant provides a "professional service" under the law, although council solicitor Phil Lauer pointed out that Brown violated the administrative code anyway by not explaining his failure to negotiate competitively in his executive order announcing the contracts.</p><p>Brown tried the same noncompetitive approach with a four-year, $715,000-plus contract with a financial consultant and two smaller consultant contracts. County Council's Finance Committee blocked the four-year deal, which was too big for even some of Brown's fellow Republicans to swallow. </p><p>But despite threats that a lawsuit was likely to result from his noncompetitively negotiated $84,000 public relations consultant contract with Sahl, council voted 5-4 on party lines to reject a resolution that would have declared it didn't approve of the process. Brown offered no hint that he was having second thoughts &#x2014; until this week, when county controller Barron met with him and then filed suit in his official capacity because he believes the contract is illegal.</p><p>Here's where the deadly snow snake slithers in. Brown announces the same day the suit is filed that he has had an abrupt change of heart but that his decision had nothing to do with being sued? </p><p>Alert Snopes.</p><p>I've been arguing all along that even in the unlikely event that it <i>is</i> legal for Brown to hire all these consultants without determining he is getting the best people at the best price, it's bad government. For that reason alone, council should have expressed its strong disapproval. Instead, its five Republicans showed less backbone than a KFC mutant chicken.</p><p>So let's journey from the Land of Outlandish Whoppers for a moment and tell the truth:</p><p>&#x2022; John Brown needs to learn from this and a lot of other mistakes he's made so far, or this will be a very long four years.</p><p>&#x2022; Steve Barron, whom I've criticized in the past for grandstanding, did exactly the right thing by demanding that Brown comply with the administrative code when County Council failed in its duties.</p><p>&#x2022; Council members who went along with Brown's efforts need to decide whether they're Daisy the Rescue Dog or Fifi the Lapdog.</p><p>More barking, less tail-wagging. Checks and balances shouldn't be a myth.</p><p><i><a href="mailto:bill.white@mcall.com">bill.white@mcall.com</a> 610-820-6105</i></p><p><i>Bill White's commentary appears Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.</i></p>
