				<p><span>KFC has been the subject of a viral rumor, with Facebook posts and emails saying that &#x201C;Kentucky Fried Chicken&#x201D; changed its name to KFC because they serve meat from mutant animals, and the U.S. government forced the move.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>However, the rumor isn&#x2019;t real, and KFC changed its name in 1991 because it wanted to deemphasize &#x201C;chicken&#x201D; as the chain serves more than just chicken. They also wanted to take the word &#x201C;fried&#x201D; out of the mix due to unhealthy connotations.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Such e-mails about KFC changing its name have been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/kfc_chicken.htm" target="_blank">around since the late 1990s.</a></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/kfc.asp" target="_blank">One of the rumors says</a>, &#x201C;KFC has been a part of American traditions for many years. Many people, day in and day out, eat at KFC religiously. Do they really know what they are eating? During a recent study of KFC done at the University of New Hampshire, they found some very upsetting facts. First of all, has anybody noticed that just recently, the company has changed their name? Kentucky Fried Chicken has become KFC. Does anybody know why? We thought the real reason was because of the &#x201C;FRIED&#x201D; food issue.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s never been study done by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.unh.edu/BoilerPlate/kfc.html" target="_blank">University of New Hampshire about KFC.</a>&#xA0;The University published a letter on its website saying that the whole thing is a &#x201C;hoax&#x201D; and &#x201C;urban legend,&#x201D; adding &#x201C;as an extra touch of false verisimilitude, there is the vague reference to a study at the University of New Hampshire!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But the hoax e-mail continues: &#x201C;The reason why they call it KFC is because they can not use the word chicken anymore. Why? KFC does not use real chickens. They actually use genetically manipulated organisms. These so called &#x201C;chickens&#x201D; are kept alive by tubes inserted into their bodies to pump blood and nutrients throughout their structure. They have no beaks, no feathers, and no feet. Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them. This is great for KFC.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On KFC&#x2019;s website, the chain says it serves &#x201C;chicken,&#x201D; and it would not be able to serve meat other than chicken&#x2013;while saying its chicken&#x2013;due to government regulations.</p>
<p>KFC also doesn&#x2019;t farm its own chickens, and it buys them from suppliers. KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut are owned by Yum! Brands, and get the products from the same source, meaning that those other chains would also have to change the names of their chicken products.</p>
