Friedkin piles on the suspense while cooly navigating the wire-taut plot&#x2019;s many twists and turns.<br> <br> But it&#x2019;s the verve he shows staging the film&#x2019;s horrific but disgustingly fascinating set pieces that is likely to cause the biggest stir.<br> <br> A gruesome torture scene involving an unholy use for a fried chicken drumstick could become every bit as iconic as that close shave doled out by Mr Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.</p><p> The performances are excellent, too. Hirsch, Gershon, Haden Church and Brit actress Temple keep their roles from straying into easy, redneck caricatures.<br> <br> It says something about their talent (or the effectiveness of Friedkin&#x2019;s famously&#xA0; hardline treatment of actors) that none of them are overshadowed by McConaughey. Because the former rom-com star is a revelation here.<br> <br> There&#x2019;s never any doubt Joe is a full-on psychopath but McConaughey never resorts to any obvious Hannibal Lecter-style theatrics.<br> <br> Instead, he plays him as a dapper, upstanding gentleman whose every controlled movement and meticulously-phrased threat seems to conform to some demented vision of southern chivalry.<br> <br> But it&#x2019;s the sexual violence simmering beneath that terrifying facade that makes him so chilling.<br> <br> Before this it was tempting to dismiss McConaughey as a six-pack flashing Hollywood beefcake.<br> <br> But he&#x2019;s just catapulted himself to the top tier of my list of movie psychos (alongside Robert Mitchum, Dennis Hopper and Joe Pesci).</p><p> It&#x2019;s his best performance by a country mile and Friedkin&#x2019;s best film since The Exorcist<br> <br> Only the faint-hearted or KFC kitchen staff should give it a miss.<br> <span><br> ANDY&#x2019;S RATING: &#x2605;</span><span>&#x2605;</span><span>&#x2605;</span><span>&#x2605;</span><br> <br> <span>Out on Friday</span>    </p></div>
