		<p>If you are Hugh Jackman, you wrap up a box set of your X-Men films.</p><p>Jackman became the first Australian invited to host one of the great American holiday traditions, the star-studded Christmas in Washington concert, which was attended by US President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle, and their daughters Sasha and Malia.</p><p>The event will be televised on US television network TNT on Friday night and Jackman joked about the decision to give an Aussie the hosting job.</p><p>"Even TNT is outsourcing these days," Jackman said.</p><p>When it came to getting the Obamas a gift, Jackman said he chose "a gift that speaks to the true meaning of Christmas: a box set of all seven X-Men and Wolverine movies".</p>
		
		  
	<p>Jackman plays mutant Wolverine in the X-Men films and spin-off Wolverine movies.</p><p>After an evening of Christmas carols at the National Building Museum, the president said Americans should remember Jesus Christ's lessons of charity and compassion.</p><p>"Through his example, he taught us that we should love the Lord, love our neighbours, as we love ourselves. It's a teaching that has endured for generations. And today, it lies at the heart of my faith and that of millions of Americans, and billions around the globe," Obama said.</p><p>"No matter who we are, or where we come from, or how we worship, it's a message of hope and devotion that can unite all of us this holiday season," he added.</p><p>Jackman also urged the audience to remember those less fortunate.</p><p>"It is the season of compassion. Let us not forget those who are down and out, who are suffering and who have little hope: the Washington Redskins fans," Jackman said. "I can say it, I'm a Giants fan."</p><p>The Redskins lost to the Atlanta Falcons earlier on Sunday and fell to 3-11 for the season. The New York Giants also lost, though, getting shut out by the Seattle Seahawks as their record fell to 5-9.</p><p>The concert included performances by the Backstreet Boys, Sheryl Crow, Anna Kendrick and Janelle Monae.</p><p>The evening ended with the Obamas, Jackman and the other guests singing Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.</p><p>"We wish this holiday season, and all holiday seasons, peace on earth," Obama said.</p><p>The concert benefited the Children's National Health System.</p>
