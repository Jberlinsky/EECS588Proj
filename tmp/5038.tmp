                    <h4>Thievery soars in Wild West as recession-hit cowboys go bad
                    </h4><p>(NEWSER) - A crime of the Old West is becoming a serious problem in 21st-century Texas, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reports. Cases of cattle rustling have more than tripled over the last couple of years, a trend investigators blame on the recession and on city-dwelling ranch owners who don't take the time to check on their cattle. A good young animal can easily fetch up to $700 at auction and thieves are finding more sophisticated ways to hide brands. <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/66608/cattle-rustling-makes-a-texas-size-comeback.html">More&#xBB;</a></p>

                    </h4><p>(NEWSER) - A Texas father who beat a man to death when he found him molesting his 5-year-old daughter will not be charged. A grand jury reviewed the evidence and agreed with police that the 23-year-old dad used authorized deadly force to protect his daughter, CNN reports. Jesus Mora Flores, 47, died due to "blunt force head and neck injury," investigators found. Forensic evidence and witness statements corroborate the father's story that his daughter was being sexually assaulted, according to the district attorney, who says she has "never seen a case this clear" in her career. <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/148473/no-charges-for-dad-who-killed-daughters-molester.html">More&#xBB;</a></p>

                    <h4>It's safest when everyone's speeding the same: official
                    </h4><p>(NEWSER) - A stretch of highway through Texas could soon have the highest officially posted speed limit in the Western hemisphere. State officials are considering an 85mph limit along a portion of new Highway 130 running between San Antonio and Austin. Critics say the speed boost will cost lives, but the state speed management director says the safest roads are ones where all motorists travel the same speed&#x2014;and studies on the new stretch find most drivers zooming along at 85mph. "The more people we can get to travel a uniform speed, the safer the conditions," he noted. <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/147667/2nd-fastest-speed-limit-in-world-coming-to-texas.html">More&#xBB;</a></p>
