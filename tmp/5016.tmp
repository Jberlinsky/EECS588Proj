That age old question has been the set up for many punch lines over the years. From, "to get to the other side," to "because he was stapled to a punk rocker," the answers to the riddle are the stuff of puns and contrived humor, and yet there are probably very few of us that hasn't laughed or groaned at a particularly bad chicken joke. My personal favorite is, "because he wanted to prove to the possum that it could be done." Ouch! "Eggsactly!"</p>


<p>I was reminded of the plethora of chicken jokes I've heard over the years recently, when the Sterling City Council took up the issue of whether or not the denizens of the city of Sterling could engage in backyard chicken ranching. This seemed to me to be a rather "non-issue" that would pass without a lot of controversy. Many much more urban settings have adopted chicken raising ordinances and civilization hasn't suffered one bit. Granted, a few coyotes in the Aurora area have gotten a little fatter and perhaps a little lazier, but there have been no "fowl" consequences in terms of public health or safety.</p>


<p>Thus it was with a mixture of bemusement and surprise that I read about the recent "chicken vote" by members of the city council. The 3-3 tie means that the ordinance failed for lack of a majority, and thus the NE Colorado City Chickens contingent will have to find another way of making it legal to raise a few birds in town. I have faith in the NE Colorado City Chickens group, though, and I suspect they will easily get enough signatures to get the issue on the next ballot. Let's hope that the wording on the ballot is so well written that no one will reject it &#x2014; you know sort of "poultry in motion."</p>


<p> Now lest you think I'm a chicken lover (other than KFC), let me assure you that nothing could be further from the truth. When I was a small lad in Otis, my 4-H project was raising chickens. I fed them, watered them, cleaned up their excrement, kept the fence tight so that the packs of wild dogs marauding through town wouldn't consume them, and collected their eggs. I got to experience being pecked and chased, slipping and falling in chicken do-do and dispatching the non-laying hens so that Sunday dinner could be served "southern fried." After a year or so of chicken delight, I was through and frankly, I don't care if I never see another one. Many folk have suggested that I should have a few free-range chickens here on the farm, and while I never resort to "fowl" language, I do let people know that chicken farming just isn't my thing.</p>


<p>Although most of us out here in the hinterlands reject "bureaucracy," it occurs to me that somehow once a person gets elected to govern, they seemingly must become a bureaucrat. Several of the questions posed by City Council members when debating the issue would lead one to believe that they have abandoned hope in terms of believing that the people in their various departments could muster up a modicum of common sense and solve issues that might arise were the City Council to be so bold as to pass the ordinance. The problem of course is that once hope for common sense is abandoned, the only other solution is "rules and regulations" many of which are merely fodder for attorneys and future lawsuits.</p>


<p>The NE Colorado City Chicken folk have worked hard to promote the responsible ownership and management of city chickens. Many places around our state and the country have adopted regulations that are working well. If having a few chickens in the backyard helps folk feel "more organic" (whatever that actually means) I say, "Let them have at it." The city council laid a big egg on this one, and ultimately, I suspect that when this is brought before the voters, the "yoke" will be on the City Council.</p>


<p>Why did the chickens cross the road? Apparently because zoning regulations in Sterling wouldn't allow them to stay.</p>
