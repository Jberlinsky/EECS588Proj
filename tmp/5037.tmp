<p>&#x201C;Grown Ups,&#x2019; the new comedy starring and co-written by Adam Sandler, is the latest entry in the movie-stars-on-filmed-vacation genre. By this, we mean a film that features real-life celebrity friends goofing off, often in an exotic or relaxing locale, and their actions just happen to be recorded for posterity. (See: &#x201C;Ocean&#x2019;s Twelve,&#x201D; &#x201C;Couples Retreat&#x201D;). Sometimes the results are watchable; more often, they are unbearable. Judging from the critic&#x2019;s reviews, &#x201C;Grown Ups&#x201D; seems to fall somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>In the film, Sandler &#x2014; whose character is married to Salma Hayek &#x2014; reunites with four members of his middle school basketball team after their beloved coach dies. Said friends just happen to be Sandler&#x2019;s former SNL co-stars Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, David Spade and honorary pal Kevin James. The quintet spend the weekend making inappropriate breast-feeding, flatulence and age-ism joke, before making personal realizations about the states of the their own lives. In other words, deep and existential stuff.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a look at what the critics are saying.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x201C;The direction by <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/classifieds?category=search1&amp;SearchType=1&amp;q=Dennis%20Dugan&amp;Class=%25&amp;FromDate=19150101&amp;ToDate=20101231">Dennis  Dugan</a> never overcomes the ungainly size of the cast. It&#x2019;s such a  challenge to keep all the characters alive that he sometimes does  round-robins of reaction shots &#x2014; a fatal strategy when it comes to  timing. Some of the dialogue is broken down into one-shots; some of the  characters spend stretches merely responding. It&#x2019;s all, as I said,  pleasant and good-natured, but it feels too much as if all these nice  people are trying to keep the conversation going. A comedy it is, but  &#x201C;The Hangover&#x201D; or &#x201C;Death at a Funeral&#x201D; it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; [Roger Ebert, <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100623/REVIEWS/100629991" target="_blank">Chicago Sun-Times</a>]</li>

<li>&#x201C;Happy Madison Productions house director Dennis Dugan&#x2019;s comic timing here is a snap-snap-let&#x2019;s-go rush to the next &#x201C;outrageous&#x201D; moment: potentially fatal pratfalls, repeated public urination, crotch hits, gushers of breast milk, Grandmama&#x2019;s infected big toe, Coach&#x2019;s ashes blown over a prominently displayed bucket of KFC Grilled Chicken&#x2026;While Sandler has never trafficked in epigrammatic wit, there&#x2019;s a difference between, say, Billy Madison&#x2019;s &#x201C;Of course I peed my pants&#x2014;everyone my age pees their pants&#x201D; or I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&#x2019;s shakedown of hetero squeamishness, and this lazy stuff&#x2014;the difference between smart-dumb and plain-dumb.&#x201D; [Nick Pinkerton, <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/film/adam-sandler-takes-vacation-with-old-snl-pals-in-grown-ups/" target="_blank">Village Voice</a>]</li>
</ul>

<li>&#x201C;Above all, this is a movie of vast and vexing illogic. And it&#x2019;s not just  the incongruity of the marriages &#x2014; James is with Maria Bello, Rock with  Maya Rudolph. They&#x2019;re such different comedians that some acting is  required for the relationships to make sense, and Rock hasn&#x2019;t actually  acted since &#x201C;New Jack City.&#x2019;&#x2019; Meanwhile, Sandler&#x2019;s character is a very  successful Hollywood agent. Why does he pretend that his brats&#x2019; nanny  (Di Quon) is a friend studying for med school? Why does it take so long  for someone to call him on it? And why would Rudolph bring her loudmouth  mother (Ebony Jo-Ann)? Why, for the fart jokes, of course &#x2014; and the  opportunity to tell you that her character&#x2019;s name is Mama Ronzoni. (It  should be noted that the women are more naturally funny in this movie  than the men, including the shockingly at ease Joyce Van Patten, who  plays Schneider&#x2019;s 70-something lady love.)&#x201D; [Wesley Morris, <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/06/24/witless_humor_with_a_heart_in_grown_ups/" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a>]</li>

<li>&#x201C;<span class="bigbody"><em>Grown Ups</em> is the latest in an ongoing  series of Sandlerian schmaltzfests that are at once achingly nostalgic  morality tales (<em>Big Daddy</em>, <em>Mr. Deeds</em>) and a stuttery  repetition of everything that has come before. All but gone is the  manic, hair-trigger man-child of <em>Billy Madison</em> and <em>Happy  Gilmore</em>. Sandler has almost entirely replaced that aspect of his  comic character with a sort of child-man who looks longingly to the past  in an effort to forestall the future. Thus we get the harried dad of <em>Click</em>,  the <em>other</em> harried dad of <em>Bedtime Stories</em>, and <em>Grown  Ups</em>&#x2019; successful (but harried) Hollywood agent (and dad) Lenny Feder,  who reunites with his four best friends from the old junior high school  basketball team only to realize that his current life, wife, and kids  are drowning in the shallows.</span>&#x201D; [Marc Savlov, <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A1043568" target="_blank">Austin Chronicle</a>]</li>
