<p>You remember her best as Joanie from &#x2018;Happy Days&#x2019; and the spin-off &#x2018;Joanie Loves Chachi&#x2019; with Scott Baio, but what&#x2019;s our former favorite sweetheart up to these days?</p>

<p><strong>Then:</strong></p>
<p>Prior to landing the gig that made her a household name, Erin Moran starred in the TV series &#x2018;Daktari,&#x2019; &#x2018;Gunsmoke,&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Waltons.&#x2019; In 1974, she was cast as Joanie Cunningham, sister of Richie and future bride of Chachi Arcola. The pair got their own spin-off in 1982, but it was short-lived, and Moran returned to &#x2018;Happy Days.&#x2019; She played Joanie for a total of 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Now:</strong></p>

<p>Sometime around 1998, Moran fell off the map. She returned in 2007 to appear on her former co-star&#x2019;s reality show, &#x2018;Scott Baio is 45 and Single,&#x2019; and starred on a season of &#x2018;Celebrity Fit Club&#x2019; in 2008. In 2011, she starred in &#x2018;Not Another B-Movie.&#x2019; </p>
<p>That same year, Moran and several of her &#x2018;Happy Days&#x2019; co-stars sued CBS for not paying them revenue from the sale of items featuring their image, including comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, DVDs and the like. Eventually the cast settled with CBS and received $65,000 each. </p>
<p>And Moran needed the money &#x2014; the actress was <a href="http://starcrush.com/erin-moran-homeless/" title="Erin Moran&#x2019;s &#x2018;Happy Days&#x2019; Are Dead and Gone" target="_blank">evicted from her trailer park home</a> last year, and as of November, she was in and out of motels and supposedly writing a book about her life.</p>
