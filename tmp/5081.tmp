  <p>NEW YORK (AP) &#x2014; It's still technically summer, but for some it's not too soon to think about what the kiddies will want for the holidays.</p>
              <p>Toys R Us has come out with its annual "hot toy" list that includes tablets for kids, fashion dolls in the likeness of boy-band sensation One Direction, and even retro hits like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Furby.</p>
              <p>Knowing early what will be popular during the holiday shopping season is crucial to retailers seeking to have the right mix of toys at the right prices. The holiday season can account for about 40 percent of a toy seller's annual profit.</p>
