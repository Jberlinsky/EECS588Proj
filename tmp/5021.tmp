        <p><a target="_blank" class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> Chicken McNuggets are one of the fast food juggernaut's core menu items. They're offered all over the world and are gobbled up by the millions.</p> <p>McDonald's has to make sure every piece is as perfect and standardized as possible — all the way down to the shape of the chicken.</p><p> So, t here's a method to the McNugget madness.</p> <p>We visited the McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., and sat in on a quality testing session. They had flown in chicken pros from suppliers like <a target="_blank" class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/tyson">Tyson</a> to grade the nuggets.</p><p>The McDonald's sensory team explained that Chicken McNuggets have four distinct shapes and in order to have a chance to meet the McDonald's "Gold Standard" for quality, they have to match them as perfectly as possible.</p><p>And each of those shapes has its own name.</p><p> Here are the four shapes of Chicken McNuggets, according to Barbara J. Booth, director of sensory science at McDonald's USA:</p> <p> Elsewhere, it seems that McDonald's uses a different name for the "bone."</p> <p> "There are four different Chicken McNugget shapes (the "boot," "ball," "bow-tie" and "bell")," <a target="_blank" href="http://yourquestions.mcdonalds.ca/questions/1294">McDonald's Canada wrote on its Q&amp;A page</a>.</p> <p> But the perfect McNugget needs a lot more than a well-aligned shape, according to McDonald's standards. The company tests flavor, breading texture, meat texture, bite firmness, color, coating, and a whole lot more. It's a strangely thorough process.</p> <p> Of course, if you've ever eaten at McDonald's, you know that this doesn't mean the nuggets come out perfectly every time in restaurants. </p> <p> It's bad when you get a tiny, mutant McNugget in your box, but it's even worse when you get a whole batch of cold, soft ones that weren't prepared properly by staff.</p> <p><em>Disclosure: McDonald's provided travel and accommodations for the trip</em> .<br></p><br><br><b>More From Business Insider </b><br>
